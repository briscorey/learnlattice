## How the game scaffolds learning

Each level narrows the decision-making in a different way:

1. Level 1 starts with small prime numbers and names the targets directly.
2. Level 2 shifts to composite numbers but keeps the number range familiar.
3. Level 3 asks students to identify all prime numbers in a mixed maze without a target list.
4. Level 4 finishes with larger composite numbers and more branching paths.

## Classroom uses

- Use it as a warm-up before a factors lesson.
- Pair it with a quick justification sheet where students explain why one number is prime or composite.
- Let students compare strategies after each level: trial division, skip even numbers, or checking factor pairs.

## Prime or composite?

A **prime number** has exactly two factors: `1` and itself.

A **composite number** has more than two factors, so it can be built from a smaller factor pair.

If students get stuck, have them ask:

- Can I make this number by multiplying two smaller whole numbers?
- Besides `1`, does any number divide it evenly?
