## Pre-algebra Bridge {#pre-algebra}

Khan Academy also uses **pre-algebra** as a bridge into formal algebraic reasoning. On LearnLattice, the closest entry points are:

- [MYP Mathematics](/subjects/mathematics/)
- [BC Grade 8 Linear Relationships and Graphs Unit](/resources/bc-grade-8-linear-relationships-and-graphs-unit/)
- [Linear Relationships — Inquiry Unit](/resources/linear-relationships-inquiry-unit/)

## Algebra Basics {#algebra-basics}

Khan Academy's **algebra basics** path is a useful next step once students are ready for more formal symbolic work.
