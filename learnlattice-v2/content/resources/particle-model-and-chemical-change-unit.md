## Overview

This unit moves students from an observable view of reactions to a particle-level explanation of chemical change. Practical investigations provide visible evidence, while diagramming and equation work help students reason about what is happening beyond direct observation.

## Learning Objectives

- Distinguish physical change from chemical change using evidence
- Use particle diagrams to explain reactions and energy transfer
- Identify common indicators of chemical reactions in lab settings
- Apply conservation of matter when interpreting word and symbol equations

## Unit Structure

### Investigation 1: What counts as evidence?

Students rotate through short demonstrations involving temperature change, gas production, precipitates, and colour change. They decide which observations justify the claim that a new substance formed.

### Investigation 2: Thinking with particles

Students model combustion, neutralisation, and simple decomposition reactions using particle cards and whiteboard diagrams. The focus is on rearrangement of particles rather than memorising equation patterns.

### Investigation 3: Conserving matter

Using closed and open-system mass data, students evaluate why mass appears to change in some practical tasks. They reconcile the data with the principle that matter is conserved.

## Assessment

The culminating task aligns with **MYP Criterion C**. Students produce a practical report in which they classify an unknown change, justify their decision with evidence, and represent the process at both macroscopic and particle scales.

> **Safety Note:** Choose low-risk microscale reactions where possible. Students focus better on evidence and reasoning when apparatus complexity is reduced.
