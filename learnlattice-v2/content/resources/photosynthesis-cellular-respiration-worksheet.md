## The Big Picture

Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are essentially **reverse processes** that together drive the carbon cycle and flow of energy through living systems.

| | Photosynthesis | Cellular Respiration |
|---|---|---|
| Location in cell | Chloroplasts | Mitochondria |
| Reactants (inputs) | CO₂ + H₂O | Glucose + O₂ |
| Products (outputs) | Glucose + O₂ | CO₂ + H₂O + ATP energy |
| Energy change | Stores energy (light → chemical) | Releases energy |
| When it occurs | Only in light | All the time |
| Which organisms | Plants, algae, some bacteria | Almost all living things |

## Part 1 — Photosynthesis

### The Equation

$$6CO_2 + 6H_2O \xrightarrow{\text{light}} C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2$$

In words: Carbon dioxide + water → glucose + oxygen (using light energy)

---

**Q1.** Label the equation with the role of each substance:

**6CO₂** — where does this come from in a leaf? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**6H₂O** — where does this come from? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Light** — where does the energy ultimately come from? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**C₆H₁₂O₆** — what is this? What does the plant use it for? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**6O₂** — what happens to the oxygen produced? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

---

**Q2.** A student says: "Plants don't need to eat because they make their own food."

a) Is this statement correct? Explain using the word equation.

*Answer:*

b) What does the plant use as raw materials to make glucose?

*Answer:*

c) Where do animals ultimately get the energy stored in glucose?

*Answer:*

---

**Q3.** The leaf is adapted for photosynthesis. Explain how each structure helps.

| Structure | How it helps photosynthesis |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| Chlorophyll (in chloroplasts) | |
| Stomata (pores in leaf) | |
| Flat, broad shape | |
| Transparent upper epidermis | |
| Palisade cells (in columns near top) | |
| Spongy mesophyll layer (with air spaces) | |

## Part 2 — Limiting Factors of Photosynthesis

A **limiting factor** is the factor in shortest supply that controls the rate of a process. Even if you add more of everything else, increasing the limiting factor is the only thing that will speed up photosynthesis.

Three main limiting factors:
1. **Light intensity** — more light = more photosynthesis (up to a point)
2. **CO₂ concentration** — more CO₂ = more photosynthesis (up to a point)
3. **Temperature** — higher temp = faster enzymes (up to optimum, then enzymes denature)

---

**Q4.** A graph of light intensity vs rate of photosynthesis shows:
- From 0–500 lux: rate increases steadily
- From 500–800 lux: rate still increases but more slowly
- Above 800 lux: rate stays constant despite more light

a) What is the limiting factor from 0–500 lux?

*Answer:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

b) What might become the new limiting factor above 800 lux?

*Answer:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

c) A plant grower adds a CO₂ generator to their greenhouse. The rate of photosynthesis increases. What does this tell you about which factor was limiting beforehand?

*Answer:*

---

**Q5.** Predict and explain what would happen to the rate of photosynthesis in each scenario:

a) Doubling the light intensity when CO₂ is very low.

*Prediction:*

*Explanation:*

b) Raising the temperature from 25°C to 45°C.

*Prediction:*

*Explanation:*

c) Moving a plant from a window to a dark cupboard.

*Prediction:*

*Explanation:*

## Part 3 — Investigating Photosynthesis

**The Pondweed Experiment**

Aquatic plants like *Elodea* (Canadian pondweed) can be used to measure photosynthesis rate by counting bubbles of oxygen released per minute.

**Setup:** Pondweed in water + lamp at various distances. Count oxygen bubbles per minute.

**Results:**

| Distance from lamp (cm) | Bubbles per minute |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| 10 | 47 |
| 20 | 28 |
| 30 | 18 |
| 40 | 12 |
| 50 | 9 |

---

**Q6.** Analysing the pondweed experiment:

a) Plot the data (distance on x-axis, bubbles/min on y-axis). Draw a smooth curve.

b) Describe the relationship between distance from lamp and rate of photosynthesis.

*Answer:*

c) Why does distance from the lamp affect light intensity? (Think about how light spreads as it travels away from a source)

*Answer:*

d) Identify one source of error in this experiment and suggest how to reduce it.

*Error:*

*Improvement:*

e) A student thinks the results would be different on a hot day vs a cold day, even with the same lamp distance. Explain whether they are correct and why.

*Answer:*

## Part 4 — Cellular Respiration

### The Equation

$$C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2 \rightarrow 6CO_2 + 6H_2O + \text{ATP energy}$$

In words: Glucose + oxygen → carbon dioxide + water + energy (as ATP)

**ATP** (adenosine triphosphate) is the cell's "energy currency" — it carries usable energy to where it's needed.

---

**Q7.** Answer these questions about cellular respiration:

a) In which organelle does aerobic respiration mainly occur?

*Answer:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

b) Every cell in your body carries out respiration, not just muscle cells. Give two examples of cell processes that require ATP energy.

*Answer:*

c) A resting person and an exercising person both respire. How would you expect the rate of respiration to differ? Why?

*Answer:*

---

**Q8.** Compare aerobic and anaerobic respiration:

| | Aerobic Respiration | Anaerobic Respiration (in humans) |
|---|---|---|
| Requires oxygen? | Yes | |
| Products | CO₂ + H₂O | Lactic acid |
| ATP produced | ~36 ATP | ~2 ATP |
| When does it occur? | | During intense exercise |
| Sustainable long-term? | Yes | |

---

**Q9.** You sprint 100 metres at full speed.

a) Can your body supply enough oxygen for aerobic respiration during the sprint? Why or why not?

*Answer:*

b) What process does your body switch to? What product builds up in your muscles?

*Answer:*

c) After the sprint, you breathe heavily for several minutes. This is called "repaying the oxygen debt." Explain what is happening during this recovery period.

*Answer:*

---

**Q10.** Yeast is a fungus that respires anaerobically:

**Glucose → ethanol + CO₂ + energy**

a) What is this process called when used to make bread or beer?

*Answer:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

b) In bread-making, which product of yeast respiration is useful? Why?

*Answer:*

c) In wine-making, which product is useful? Why?

*Answer:*

d) Why does yeast switch to anaerobic respiration when there is no oxygen?

*Answer:*

*Answer:*

b) At night, which process occurs? What evidence would you expect?

*Answer:*

c) The "compensation point" is the light intensity at which the rate of photosynthesis exactly equals the rate of respiration. Draw a sketch graph showing how net oxygen production changes with light intensity, and mark the compensation point.
