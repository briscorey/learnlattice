## What is Classification?

Scientists classify living things into groups based on shared characteristics. This helps us:
- Communicate clearly about species
- Understand evolutionary relationships
- Predict characteristics of unknown organisms
- Identify and protect endangered species

---

## Part 1 — The Classification Hierarchy

Living things are sorted into groups from broadest to most specific:

**Domain → Kingdom → Phylum → Class → Order → Family → Genus → Species**

Memory aid: **D**ear **K**ing **P**hillip **C**ame **O**ver **F**or **G**reat **S**paghetti

The scientific name of an organism uses **Genus** and **species** (e.g., *Homo sapiens* for humans).

**Rules for scientific names:**
- Written in italics (or underlined when handwritten)
- Genus is capitalised; species is lowercase
- Based on Latin or Greek

---

**Q1.** Use the hierarchy (Domain → Kingdom → Phylum → Class → Order → Family → Genus → Species) to answer:

a) Which level is the broadest grouping? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

b) Which level is the most specific? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

c) Two organisms belong to the same **Order** but different **Families**. Are they more or less closely related than two organisms from the same **Family**? Explain.

*Answer:*

---

**Q2.** Fill in the classification table for these organisms:

| | Human | House cat | Tiger | Domestic dog |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Kingdom | Animalia | Animalia | Animalia | Animalia |
| Phylum | Chordata | Chordata | | Chordata |
| Class | Mammalia | Mammalia | Mammalia | |
| Order | Primates | Carnivora | | Carnivora |
| Family | Hominidae | Felidae | Felidae | Canidae |
| Genus | *Homo* | *Felis* | *Panthera* | *Canis* |
| Species | *sapiens* | *catus* | *tigris* | *lupus familiaris* |

a) Based on this table, which two organisms are most closely related? How do you know?

*Answer:*

b) Write the correct scientific name for a tiger.

*Answer:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

## Part 2 — The Five Kingdoms

| Kingdom | Cell Type | Cell Wall? | Nutrition | Examples |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Animalia | Eukaryotic | No | Heterotrophic (eat food) | Dog, eagle, fish |
| Plantae | Eukaryotic | Yes (cellulose) | Autotrophic (photosynthesis) | Oak tree, fern, moss |
| Fungi | Eukaryotic | Yes (chitin) | Heterotrophic (absorb from dead matter) | Mushroom, yeast |
| Protista | Eukaryotic | Varies | Varies | Amoeba, algae |
| Monera | Prokaryotic | Varies | Varies | Bacteria |

---

**Q3.** Classify each organism into the correct kingdom. Explain your reasoning.

a) A mushroom. It has cell walls but cannot photosynthesise and gets nutrients by breaking down dead leaves.

*Kingdom:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ *Reason:*

b) A single-celled organism found in pond water. It has a nucleus and moves using a tail-like structure.

*Kingdom:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ *Reason:*

c) An organism with no nucleus, found in your stomach helping you digest food.

*Kingdom:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ *Reason:*

d) An organism that makes its own food using sunlight, has cell walls made of cellulose, and cannot move.

*Kingdom:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ *Reason:*

---

**Q4.** A virus is **not** classified in any of the five kingdoms. Research or reason through:

a) Why do scientists debate whether viruses are "alive"?

*Answer:*

b) List two properties of living things that viruses have, and two they lack.

| Living things viruses DO have | Living things viruses DON'T have |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| | |
| | |

## Part 3 — Dichotomous Keys

A **dichotomous key** is a tool that identifies organisms through a series of yes/no questions.

**Q5.** Use the dichotomous key below to identify the animals A–E.

**Animals:** Sea turtle, Shark, Salmon, Frog, Snake

```
1a. Has a backbone (vertebrate) ............... go to 2
1b. No backbone (invertebrate) ................. not listed here

2a. Lives in water only ........................... go to 3
2b. Can live on land and in water ............. go to 4

3a. Has scales, breathes with gills ........... go to 5
3b. Has a shell, breathes with lungs .......... Sea turtle

4a. Has moist, smooth skin ....................... Frog
4b. Has dry, scaly skin ........................... Snake

5a. Has a cartilaginous skeleton ............... Shark
5b. Has a bony skeleton .......................... Salmon
```

| Animal | Key Steps Used | Identity |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| A — breathes with lungs, has a shell | 1a → 2a → 3b | |
| B — has smooth moist skin, can hop | | |
| C — has a bony skeleton, gills | | |
| D — dry scales, no legs | | |
| E — cartilage skeleton, never leaves water | | |

---

**Q6.** Create your own dichotomous key to distinguish between these six items:

**Items:** Apple, Banana, Tomato, Pea, Watermelon, Lemon

Write your key as a series of branching yes/no questions. Test it to make sure each item ends at a unique answer.

*Your key:*

```
1a. __________________________________ → go to 2
1b. __________________________________ → go to 3

2a. __________________________________ → Apple
2b. __________________________________ → 

3a. __________________________________ → 
3b. __________________________________ → go to 4

(continue...)
```

## Part 4 — Measuring Biodiversity

**Biodiversity** refers to the variety of life in an area — both the number of different species (species richness) and how evenly they are distributed (evenness).

### Simpson's Diversity Index

$$D = 1 - \frac{\sum n(n-1)}{N(N-1)}$$

Where:
- n = number of individuals of each species
- N = total number of individuals
- D ranges from 0 (no diversity) to 1 (maximum diversity)

**A higher D = more diverse ecosystem**

---

### Worked Example

A meadow has: 10 daisies, 6 buttercups, 4 dandelions = N = 20 total

| Species | n | n(n−1) |
|---------|---|--------|
| Daisy | 10 | 90 |
| Buttercup | 6 | 30 |
| Dandelion | 4 | 12 |
| **Total** | 20 | 132 |

D = 1 − 132/(20 × 19) = 1 − 132/380 = 1 − 0.347 = **0.653**

---

**Q7.** Two forest plots were surveyed. Calculate Simpson's Diversity Index for each.

**Plot 1:**

| Species | n | n(n−1) |
|---------|---|--------|
| Oak | 15 | |
| Birch | 12 | |
| Pine | 8 | |
| Ash | 5 | |
| **Total N** | | |

D = 1 − \_\_\_\_ / (\_\_\_\_ × \_\_\_\_) = \_\_\_\_

---

**Plot 2:**

| Species | n | n(n−1) |
|---------|---|--------|
| Oak | 38 | |
| Birch | 2 | |
| Pine | 1 | |
| Ash | 1 | |
| **Total N** | | |

D = 1 − \_\_\_\_ / (\_\_\_\_ × \_\_\_\_) = \_\_\_\_

---

**Q8.** Compare the two plots:

a) Which plot has higher species richness? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

b) Which plot has a higher D value? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

c) Why does Plot 2 have a lower D value even though it has the same number of species?

*Answer:*

d) Which plot represents a healthier, more stable ecosystem? Explain.

*Answer:*

---

## Part 5 — Conservation and Threats to Biodiversity

**Q9.** The table shows the estimated number of species extinct or threatened since 1900.

| Group | Species known | Estimated extinct | Critically endangered |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Mammals | 5,500 | 83 | 225 |
| Birds | 10,000 | 140 | 222 |
| Reptiles | 9,000 | 22 | 205 |
| Amphibians | 7,300 | 38 | 534 |
| Fish | 33,000 | 80 | 1,175 |

a) Which group has the highest percentage of known species that are critically endangered? Show your calculation.

*Working:*

*Answer:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

b) Amphibians are described as an "indicator species" — their health signals the health of an ecosystem. What does the amphibian data suggest about global ecosystem health?

*Answer:*

---

**Q10.** Identify and explain **three** major threats to biodiversity. For each, give a real-world example.

| Threat | Explanation | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| 1. | | |
| 2. | | |
| 3. | | |

---

**Q11.** A conservation group wants to protect a forest. They are debating two strategies:

- **Strategy A:** Protect a single large reserve (100 km²) with all species
- **Strategy B:** Protect four smaller reserves (25 km² each) scattered across the region

Using what you know about biodiversity, connectivity, and habitat fragmentation, evaluate both strategies. Which would you recommend and why?

*Your evaluation:*

---

## Reflection

**Q12.** Carl Linnaeus, the father of modern classification, created the binomial naming system in the 1750s. He thought organisms were fixed and unchanging. Charles Darwin later showed that species evolve from common ancestors.

How does modern classification reflect both Linnaeus's system AND Darwin's ideas about evolution? What does it mean when we say two organisms are "closely related" in evolutionary terms?
