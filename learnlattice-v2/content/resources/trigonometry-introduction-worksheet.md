## The Three Trigonometric Ratios

Trigonometry works with **right-angled triangles**. The ratios connect the angles to the sides.

First, you must **name the sides relative to the angle you're working with** (θ, "theta"):

- **Hypotenuse (H):** Always the longest side, opposite the right angle
- **Opposite (O):** The side directly opposite angle θ
- **Adjacent (A):** The side next to angle θ (that isn't the hypotenuse)

### The Ratios — SOH CAH TOA

$$\sin\theta = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Hypotenuse}} \quad \cos\theta = \frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\text{Hypotenuse}} \quad \tan\theta = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Adjacent}}$$

**Memory trick: SOH CAH TOA**

## Part 1 — Naming the Sides

**Q1.** For each triangle, label the sides as Hypotenuse (H), Opposite (O), and Adjacent (A) relative to the marked angle θ.

*(For this worksheet, sketch each triangle yourself based on the description and label accordingly.)*

a) A right triangle with θ at the bottom left.

b) A right triangle with θ at the top.

c) A right triangle with θ at the bottom right.

---

**Q2.** For a right-angled triangle where θ = 35° and the hypotenuse = 10 cm, which sides are Opposite and Adjacent to θ? Write which ratio (sin, cos, or tan) you would use to find:

a) The opposite side: use \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

b) The adjacent side: use \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

---

## Part 2 — Finding Missing Sides

### Worked Example 1 — Finding the Opposite Side

> A right triangle has θ = 30° and hypotenuse = 8 cm. Find the opposite side.

We know: θ, H. We want: O. → Use **sin**

sin 30° = O/H → O = H × sin 30° = 8 × 0.5 = **4 cm**

---

### Worked Example 2 — Finding the Adjacent Side

> A right triangle has θ = 50° and hypotenuse = 12 cm. Find the adjacent side.

We know: θ, H. We want: A. → Use **cos**

cos 50° = A/H → A = H × cos 50° = 12 × 0.643 = **7.72 cm** (2 d.p.)

---

**Q3.** Calculate the missing side. Round to 2 decimal places. Show all working.

a) θ = 40°, H = 15 cm. Find O.

*Which ratio?* \_\_\_\_\_

---

b) θ = 60°, H = 20 cm. Find A.

*Which ratio?* \_\_\_\_\_

*Working:*

*Answer:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ cm

---

c) θ = 25°, A = 10 cm. Find O.

*Which ratio?* \_\_\_\_\_ (Hint: you have A and want O — use tan)

*Working:*

*Answer:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ cm

---

d) θ = 55°, O = 7 cm. Find H.

*Which ratio?* \_\_\_\_\_ (Rearrange: H = O/sin θ)

*Working:*

*Answer:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ cm

---

e) θ = 72°, A = 9 cm. Find H.

*Working:*

*Answer:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ cm

---

**Q4.** A right triangle has θ = 45° and hypotenuse = 10 cm.

a) Find the opposite side.

b) Find the adjacent side.

c) What do you notice? Why does this make sense given that θ = 45°?

*Answer:*

## Part 3 — Finding Missing Angles

To find an angle, use the **inverse trigonometric functions**: sin⁻¹, cos⁻¹, tan⁻¹ (on your calculator these are usually SHIFT + sin, cos, tan).

### Worked Example

> A right triangle has opposite side = 5 cm and hypotenuse = 9 cm. Find θ.

sin θ = O/H = 5/9 = 0.556

θ = sin⁻¹(0.556) = **33.75°** (2 d.p.)

---

**Q5.** Find the angle θ. Round to 1 decimal place.

a) O = 4 cm, H = 10 cm

*sin θ = \_\_\_\_ → θ = \_\_\_\_°*

---

b) A = 7 cm, H = 11 cm

*cos θ = \_\_\_\_ → θ = \_\_\_\_°*

---

c) O = 6 cm, A = 8 cm

*tan θ = \_\_\_\_ → θ = \_\_\_\_°*

---

d) O = 12 cm, H = 13 cm

*θ = \_\_\_\_°*

---

e) A = 5 cm, O = 12 cm

*θ = \_\_\_\_°*

---

**Q6.** A right-angled triangle has legs of 3 cm and 4 cm (the right angle is between them).

a) Find the hypotenuse (use Pythagoras).

b) Find the two non-right angles using trigonometry.

c) Check: Do all three angles sum to 180°? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

## Part 4 — Real-World Applications

**Q7. The Flagpole**

A flagpole casts a shadow 12 m long. The angle of elevation of the sun is 35°.

a) Draw and label a diagram. Identify which sides are opposite, adjacent, and hypotenuse relative to the 35° angle.

b) Which trigonometric ratio should you use?

c) Calculate the height of the flagpole.

**Q8. The Roof**

A roof has a span of 8 m (the full width). The peak of the roof is 2.5 m above the top of the walls. 

a) Draw a diagram. The triangular cross-section of the roof has a base of 8 m and height of 2.5 m. The right angle is at the peak (it's an isosceles triangle — the ridge sits in the middle).

b) Find the angle each side of the roof makes with the horizontal.

*Working:*

*Answer:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_°

c) Find the length of each sloping side of the roof.

*Working:*

*Answer:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ m

b) A lighthouse sits on top of the cliff. From the ship, the angle of elevation to the top of the lighthouse is 21°. Find the height of the lighthouse.

*Working:*

*(Hint: find the total height first, then subtract the cliff height)*

**Q10. The Ramp (Revisited)**

b) Wheelchair accessibility guidelines require ramps to be no steeper than 4.8°. Does this ramp comply?

*Answer:*

## Part 5 — Bearings (Extension)

Bearings measure direction clockwise from **North (0°)**. They are always written as three digits (e.g., 045°, not 45°).

**Q11.** A ship travels 15 km on a bearing of 060°.

a) Draw a diagram showing the ship's path. (North is straight up.)

b) How far **east** (horizontal) has the ship travelled?

*Working:* (Hint: east is the opposite side to the 60° angle from North)
