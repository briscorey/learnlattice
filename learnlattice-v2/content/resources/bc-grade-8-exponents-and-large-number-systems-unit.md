## Overview

Students investigate repeated multiplication, growth, and compact notation through contexts involving scale and scientific data. The unit links symbolic exponent rules to structural reasoning.

## BC Curriculum Focus

- BC big idea: Number concepts and operations can be extended to very large and very small quantities.
- BC content links: powers, exponent laws, square roots, and efficient representation of scale.

## Inquiry Questions

**Factual:** Why do exponent laws make sense structurally rather than by memorization alone?

**Conceptual:** When is exponential notation more useful than standard form?

**Debatable:** How does compact notation change the way we reason about size?

## Learning Flow

- Model repeated multiplication with area and scale tasks.
- Test and justify exponent laws through numerical and visual reasoning.
- Conclude with a scale-comparison task using science or technology data.

## Assessment Alignment

The unit emphasises **MYP Criterion A** conceptual understanding and **Criterion C** communication of symbolic reasoning and justification.

> **Teaching Tip:** Make students invent the rule before you formalize it. They retain it better when it solves a representational problem.
