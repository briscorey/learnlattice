## Overview

This task asks students to interpret climate graphs and species distribution data to explain how biomes shift over time. The emphasis is on reading patterns carefully, then linking those patterns to habitat change and biodiversity risk.

## Student Tasks

### Dataset 1: Climate graphs

Students compare long-term temperature and rainfall records for two regions, identify trends, and describe how seasonal patterns are changing.

### Dataset 2: Biome boundaries

Students analyse maps showing vegetation or habitat distribution over time and infer how biome zones are moving or shrinking.

### Dataset 3: Species impact

Students connect climate and biome shifts to the survival of selected species. They explain which organisms are most vulnerable and why.

## Output

Students produce a short analytical report that combines graph interpretation, map evidence, and a conclusion about ecosystem resilience.

## Assessment

The task aligns with **MYP Criterion C** because students must communicate scientific interpretations clearly, select relevant evidence, and explain uncertainty without overstating what the data shows.

> **Teaching Tip:** Ask students to mark anomalies separately from trends. They often improve their written conclusions once those are not treated as the same thing.
