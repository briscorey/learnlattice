## Overview

Students explore how electrical energy is transferred, controlled, and measured in practical systems. They build increasingly complex circuits, interpret patterns mathematically, and evaluate design tradeoffs.

## BC Curriculum Focus

- Big idea: Electric current is the flow of electric charge.
- BC content links: series and parallel circuits, voltage, current, resistance, and electrical energy transformation in devices and systems.

## Inquiry Questions

**Factual:** What actually changes when a circuit design is altered?

**Conceptual:** How do measurement and model-based reasoning work together in electricity?

**Debatable:** When should efficiency, safety, and cost outweigh raw performance in a design?

## Learning Flow

- Use probes and test circuits to reveal current, resistance, and potential difference.
- Compare circuit behaviours through measured and simulated models.
- End with a design challenge in which students optimize an electrical system for a stated purpose.

## Assessment Alignment

Assessment foregrounds **MYP Criterion B** for testing and redesign and **Criterion C** for quantitative processing, graphing, and evidence-based explanation.

> **Teaching Tip:** Require students to predict meter readings before they test. It slows them down in a useful way.
