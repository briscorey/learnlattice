## Overview

Students use ray evidence, image investigations, and technology analysis to understand how light behaves. The unit positions optics as both a physical science topic and a design context for solving real problems.

## BC Curriculum Focus

- Big idea: Light can be reflected, refracted, and absorbed.
- BC content links: properties of light, image formation, lenses, mirrors, and applications in optical technologies.

## Inquiry Questions

**Factual:** How do we know where light went if we only see the result?

**Conceptual:** Why are some light models useful even when they are incomplete?

**Debatable:** How should optical technologies balance clarity, cost, and accessibility?

## Learning Flow

- Trace reflection and refraction patterns in guided practicals.
- Use lenses and mirrors to solve image and visibility problems.
- Conclude with an assistive or observational device design brief.

## Assessment Alignment

This unit connects **MYP Criterion B** to practical inquiry and **Criterion D** to technology application, design justification, and impact-focused reasoning.

> **Teaching Tip:** Use black boxes, periscopes, or mystery lenses so students have to infer rather than simply confirm.
