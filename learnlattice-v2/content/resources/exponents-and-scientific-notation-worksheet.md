|-----|------|---------|
| Multiplication | aᵐ × aⁿ = aᵐ⁺ⁿ | 3² × 3⁴ = 3⁶ |
| Division | aᵐ ÷ aⁿ = aᵐ⁻ⁿ | 5⁶ ÷ 5² = 5⁴ |
| Power of a power | (aᵐ)ⁿ = aᵐⁿ | (2³)² = 2⁶ |
| Zero exponent | a⁰ = 1 (a ≠ 0) | 7⁰ = 1 |
| Negative exponent | a⁻ⁿ = 1/aⁿ | 2⁻³ = 1/8 |

## Part 4 — Scientific Notation

Scientific notation (also called standard form) expresses numbers as:

$$A \times 10^n$$

Where **1 ≤ A < 10** and n is an integer.

### Converting to Scientific Notation

**Large numbers:** Count how many places you move the decimal point left → positive n

Example: 3,400,000 = 3.4 × 10⁶

**Small numbers:** Count places moved right → negative n

Example: 0.00045 = 4.5 × 10⁻⁴

---

a) 72,000 = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

b) 5,600,000,000 = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

d) 0.000000091 = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

e) 843 = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

f) 0.1 = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

---

**Q11.** Write as ordinary numbers.

a) 6.2 × 10⁴ = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

b) 1.5 × 10⁸ = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

c) 3.8 × 10⁻³ = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

3.2 × 10⁵, 8.1 × 10⁴, 2.5 × 10⁵, 1.9 × 10⁶, 6.0 × 10⁻²

*Smallest → Largest:*

## Part 5 — Calculating with Scientific Notation

**Rule:** For multiplication: multiply the A values, add the powers.
**Rule:** For division: divide the A values, subtract the powers.
**Important:** Always check that your answer is still in proper scientific notation (1 ≤ A < 10).

### Worked Example

> (3 × 10⁴) × (2 × 10⁵) = (3 × 2) × 10⁴⁺⁵ = 6 × 10⁹

> (8 × 10⁶) ÷ (4 × 10²) = (8 ÷ 4) × 10⁶⁻² = 2 × 10⁴

a) (4 × 10³) × (3 × 10⁵) = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

b) (6 × 10⁸) ÷ (2 × 10³) = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

c) (5 × 10⁴) × (3 × 10⁷) = \_\_\_\_\_ (Careful: 15 is not between 1 and 10!)

d) (7 × 10²) × (4 × 10⁻⁵) = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

e) (9 × 10⁻³) ÷ (3 × 10⁻⁷) = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

## Part 7 — Investigation: Powers of 2

**Q15.** Investigate doubling — a pattern that appears in biology, finance, computing, and epidemics.

a) Complete the table:

| n (doublings) | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
|--------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Value (2ⁿ) | 1 | 2 | | | | | | | |

b) If a single bacterium doubles every 20 minutes, complete this table:

| Time (min) | 0 | 20 | 40 | 60 | 80 | 100 | 120 |
|-----------|---|----|----|----|----|-----|-----|
| Number of bacteria | 1 | 2 | | | | | |

c) After 6 hours (360 minutes), how many doublings have occurred? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

d) Write the number of bacteria after 6 hours as a power of 2: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

e) Convert to scientific notation: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

f) This growth is called **exponential growth**. Why does it become alarming after many doublings, even though each individual doubling seems small?

*Answer:*

## Reflection

**Q16.** Negative exponents often confuse students. A common mistake is to think that a negative exponent makes the answer negative.

a) Is 2⁻³ negative? What is its value?

b) Write a rule you can use to remember what negative exponents mean.

c) Explain to a younger student why 10⁻² = 0.01 (not −100) using your own words.
