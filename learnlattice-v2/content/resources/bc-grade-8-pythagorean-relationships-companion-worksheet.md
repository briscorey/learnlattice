## Overview

This worksheet sequence extends [BC Grade 8 Pythagorean Relationships Unit](/resources/bc-grade-8-pythagorean-relationships-unit/) with guided practice, pattern spotting, and reflection prompts that keep the inquiry-based structure intact while giving students more independent processing time.

## What's Included

- A short launch task that reactivates the main pattern, model, or relationship from the unit.
- Worked examples with space for students to explain why a method works, not only what to do.
- Independent tasks that shift from scaffolded reasoning to unfamiliar application.
- A metacognitive reflection prompt tied to strategy choice, representation, or model critique.

## Inquiry Prompts

**Factual:** What new evidence or pattern becomes visible when students work through this task carefully?

**Conceptual:** How does this companion task deepen the main relationship or system from the unit instead of repeating it?

**Debatable:** What should count as a strong explanation or justified solution in this topic?

## MYP Alignment

This companion resource primarily supports **MYP Criterion C** through clear mathematical communication, with extension prompts into **Criterion D** whenever students apply ideas in a contextual task.

## Suggested Use

Use it after students have explored the core concept through discussion or modelling. It works well as consolidation, station rotation material, or a structured bridge into assessment.

> **Teaching Tip:** Keep the written structure, but trim any repeated instructions once students show they can carry the inquiry routine independently.
