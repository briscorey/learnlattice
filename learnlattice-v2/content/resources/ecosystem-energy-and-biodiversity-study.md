## Overview

This resource guides students through an ecosystem case study that combines food-web modelling with biodiversity sampling. Students investigate how energy moves through a habitat, then use field data to evaluate how resilient that ecosystem is under human pressure.

## Key Understandings

Students will understand that:
- Energy flow through ecosystems is directional and decreases at each trophic level
- Biodiversity can be measured using sampling strategies and comparative data
- Human actions can change the stability of ecosystems in both visible and subtle ways

## Fieldwork Components

### Survey 1: Food-web mapping

Students identify producers, herbivores, omnivores, decomposers, and apex consumers in a selected habitat. They create a food web and explain how removing one species affects the broader system.

### Survey 2: Biodiversity sampling

Using quadrats or transects, students gather frequency and abundance data from two contrasting sites. They compare biodiversity levels and discuss the reliability of their sampling method.

### Survey 3: Human impact analysis

Students examine evidence of litter, trampling, runoff, habitat fragmentation, or invasive species. They decide which impact has the strongest effect on ecosystem stability and justify their claim with collected evidence.

## Assessment

The final task targets **MYP Criterion D**. Students write an evidence-based ecosystem evaluation in which they interpret data, acknowledge limitations, and recommend one realistic intervention to improve habitat quality.

> **Fieldwork Note:** Build in time for students to revisit one sampling location. Comparing repeat data usually leads to stronger discussions about reliability than a teacher explanation alone.
