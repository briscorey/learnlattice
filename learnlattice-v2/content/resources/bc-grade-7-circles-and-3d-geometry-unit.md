## Overview

Students investigate circles and three-dimensional shapes through measurement, construction, and design. The unit asks them to connect geometric properties to practical decisions about packaging, movement, and space.

## BC Curriculum Focus

- BC big idea: Geometric properties help us describe, compare, and construct objects in space.
- BC content links: circles, radius, diameter, circumference, area relationships, 3D objects, and nets.

## Inquiry Questions

**Factual:** Why does pi appear whenever we measure circles?

**Conceptual:** How do 2D nets help us reason about 3D objects?

**Debatable:** When do exact values matter more than practical approximations?

## Learning Flow

- Measure circles and infer relationships among radius, diameter, and circumference.
- Construct and critique nets for 3D objects in packaging contexts.
- Conclude with a design challenge grounded in geometric constraints.

## Assessment Alignment

The unit targets **MYP Criterion A** understanding and **Criterion D** by applying geometric reasoning to a functional design task.

> **Teaching Tip:** Let students approximate pi from real measurements before formalizing it.
