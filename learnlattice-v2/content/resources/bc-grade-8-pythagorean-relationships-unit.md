## Overview

Students explore why the Pythagorean relationship works and how it helps solve inaccessible distance problems. Visual proof, measurement, and context tasks make the theorem a reasoning tool instead of a shortcut.

## BC Curriculum Focus

- BC big idea: Spatial relationships can be described and justified using mathematical models.
- BC content links: right triangles, square numbers, distance, and the Pythagorean relationship.

## Inquiry Questions

**Factual:** Why does the Pythagorean relationship work only for right triangles?

**Conceptual:** How do visual proofs strengthen algebraic formulas?

**Debatable:** When is an indirect measurement more powerful than a direct one?

## Learning Flow

- Build and compare area models on right triangles.
- Apply the relationship to maps, ramps, and inaccessible measurements.
- Finish with an engineering-style task that requires justified dimensions.

## Assessment Alignment

This unit develops **MYP Criterion A** understanding and **Criterion D** application to spatial and design-based problems.

> **Teaching Tip:** Use proof before plug-and-chug. Students need to trust the relationship conceptually.
