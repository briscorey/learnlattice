## Part 1 — The Greenhouse Effect

**Background:** The Earth is warmed by the Sun. The surface radiates heat back as infrared radiation. **Greenhouse gases** (CO₂, methane, water vapour, nitrous oxide) absorb some of this heat and re-radiate it back to Earth — like a blanket.

Without the greenhouse effect, Earth's average temperature would be about **−18°C** instead of the current **+15°C**. The greenhouse effect is natural and essential for life.

The problem is the **enhanced greenhouse effect** — human activities are increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, trapping more heat.

---

**Q1.** Using the background text:

a) What is the role of greenhouse gases in the natural greenhouse effect?

*Answer:*

b) Why is the natural greenhouse effect beneficial?

*Answer:*

c) What is the "enhanced greenhouse effect" and what causes it?

*Answer:*

d) List four greenhouse gases.

*Answer:*

## Part 2 — Atmospheric CO₂ Data

**The Keeling Curve** — CO₂ measurements taken at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, since 1958 (parts per million, ppm):

| Year | CO₂ (ppm) |
|------|-----------|
| 1960 | 317 |
| 1970 | 326 |
| 1980 | 339 |
| 1990 | 354 |
| 2000 | 369 |
| 2005 | 380 |
| 2010 | 390 |
| 2015 | 401 |
| 2020 | 414 |
| 2023 | 421 |

Pre-industrial average (before 1750): approximately **280 ppm**

---

**Q2.** Analysing CO₂ data:

a) Plot the data on a graph. Put Year on the x-axis (1960–2023) and CO₂ (ppm) on the y-axis (300–430 ppm range recommended).

b) Describe the trend shown in your graph.

*Answer:*

c) Calculate the increase in CO₂ from 1960 to 2023.

*Increase:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ppm

d) Calculate the percentage increase from the pre-industrial level (280 ppm) to 2023.

*Working:* (421 − 280)/280 × 100 = \_\_\_\_\_%

e) Calculate the average annual increase in CO₂ between 2010 and 2023.

*Working:*

*Average increase:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ppm/year

f) If this rate continues, predict the CO₂ level in 2040.

*Answer:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ppm (Note: state this is an extrapolation and may not be accurate)

---

**Q3.** The Keeling Curve also shows a **sawtooth pattern** — CO₂ rises slightly in Northern Hemisphere winter and falls in summer, on top of the overall increase.

a) Suggest why CO₂ is higher in winter and lower in summer in the Northern Hemisphere.

*(Hint: Think about plants and photosynthesis)*

*Answer:*

b) This annual cycle is much smaller than the long-term trend. What does this tell you about which factor (seasonal or industrial) is dominant?

*Answer:*

## Part 3 — Temperature Data

**Global mean surface temperature anomaly** — the difference from the 1951–1980 average (°C):

| Year | Temperature Anomaly (°C) |
|------|------------------------|
| 1880 | −0.20 |
| 1900 | −0.08 |
| 1920 | −0.28 |
| 1940 | +0.09 |
| 1960 | −0.01 |
| 1970 | +0.02 |
| 1980 | +0.26 |
| 1990 | +0.44 |
| 2000 | +0.42 |
| 2010 | +0.72 |
| 2015 | +0.87 |
| 2020 | +1.02 |
| 2023 | +1.17 |

---

**Q4.** Analysing temperature data:

a) Plot the temperature anomaly data on a graph. Put Year on the x-axis and Anomaly (°C) on the y-axis.

b) Describe the overall trend.

*Answer:*

c) Identify one period where temperatures temporarily decreased. What might cause short-term cooling even during a long-term warming trend?

*(Research hint: Think about major volcanic eruptions)*

*Answer:*

d) How much has the global average temperature changed between 1880 and 2023?

*Answer:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ °C

e) Compare your CO₂ graph (Q2) with your temperature graph. Describe any relationship you notice.

*Answer:*

---

**Q5.** The Paris Agreement (2015) aims to limit global warming to **1.5°C** above pre-industrial levels.

a) Based on the 2023 anomaly of +1.17°C above the 1951–1980 baseline, and knowing the pre-industrial temperature was approximately 0.3°C below that baseline, has the world already passed the 1.5°C threshold?

*Working:* 1951–1980 baseline is \_\_\_°C above pre-industrial. 2023 is \_\_\_°C above that baseline. Total warming = \_\_\_°C.

*Answer:*

b) What does "net zero by 2050" mean, and why is 2050 considered important?

*Answer:*

## Part 4 — Ice Cores and Historical Data

Ice cores drilled from Antarctica contain air bubbles trapped when the ice formed — like a record of ancient atmospheres. Scientists can measure CO₂ and temperature going back 800,000 years.

**Data from Vostok ice core (approximate values):**

| Period | CO₂ (ppm) | Approximate temperature change from today |
|--------|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| Today (2023) | 421 | 0 |
| 1800 AD | 280 | −0.2°C |
| Last ice age (20,000 yr ago) | 180 | −5°C |
| Previous warm period (130,000 yr ago) | 280 | +1°C |
| Peak CO₂ (800,000 yr record) | 300 | Varied |

---

**Q6.** Using the ice core data:

a) What pattern do you notice between CO₂ levels and temperature across geological time?

*Answer:*

b) Today's CO₂ of 421 ppm is significantly higher than any level in the 800,000-year ice core record. Why is this significant?

*Answer:*

c) During the last ice age, CO₂ was 180 ppm and it was 5°C colder. Today CO₂ is 421 ppm — a much larger increase from 280 ppm. What does this suggest about future temperature changes?

*Answer:*

d) A climate sceptic says "CO₂ and temperature have both risen and fallen naturally for millions of years — so today's changes are just natural cycles." Write a 3–4 sentence response that engages with this argument using evidence.

*Your response:*

## Part 5 — Consequences and Evidence

**Q7.** Match each observed consequence to its mechanism. Draw lines or write the letter.

**Consequences:**
A. Sea level rise
B. More intense hurricanes
C. Coral bleaching
D. Glacier retreat
E. Shifting seasons (earlier springs)
F. Species range shifts (animals moving poleward)

**Mechanisms:**
1. Warmer oceans provide more energy to storm systems
2. Higher temperatures cause thermal expansion of ocean water and ice melt
3. Rising temperatures make previously cold regions habitable
4. Warmer ocean water damages the symbiotic algae that give corals colour and nutrients
5. Warming air and water melt ice at higher rates than snowfall replaces it
6. Temperatures that trigger flowering, migration, and breeding are reached earlier

---

**Q8.** Sea level data:

Satellite measurements show sea level has risen approximately 3.6 mm per year from 1993 to 2023.

a) Calculate the total sea level rise from 1993 to 2023.

*Working:*

*Answer:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ mm = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ cm

b) By 2100, models predict sea levels could rise 0.6–1.0 m. For a coastal city like Shanghai (average elevation 4 m), what challenges might a 1 m rise create?

*Answer:*

---

## Part 6 — Evaluating Sources

**Q9.** For each statement, evaluate the source. Rate the **credibility** (1 = low, 5 = high) and explain your reasoning.

| Claim | Source | Credibility (1–5) | Reason |
|-------|--------|-------------------|--------|
| "Climate change is the greatest threat to humanity" | Peer-reviewed paper in Nature, 2023 | | |
| "CO₂ is plant food — more CO₂ means better crop yields" | Website funded by fossil fuel industry | | |
| "Scientists disagree about whether climate change is human-caused" | News article, 2023 | | |
| "97% of climate scientists agree humans are causing warming" | NASA, citing multiple studies | | |
| "My town had a cold winter — so global warming isn't real" | Social media post | | |

---

**Q10.** What is the difference between **weather** and **climate**? Why is it incorrect to argue against climate change by pointing to a cold winter?

*Answer:*

## Reflection — Returning to What You Knew

**Q11.** Return to your three statements at the beginning.

For each one:
- Was it accurate, partially accurate, or incorrect?
- What evidence from this worksheet supports or challenges it?

**Statement 1:** 

**Statement 2:**

**Statement 3:**

---

**Q12.** Scientists have high confidence that climate change is real and human-caused. But some policy-makers disagree about what to do about it. What is the difference between a **scientific question** ("Is climate change happening?") and a **policy question** ("What should we do about it?")? Why does this distinction matter?
