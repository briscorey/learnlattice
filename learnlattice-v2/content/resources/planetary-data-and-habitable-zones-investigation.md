## Overview

This investigation gives students a structured dataset on planets and exoplanet candidates. They compare orbital distance, temperature range, atmosphere, and surface conditions to evaluate whether a world might support life as we understand it.

## Investigation Questions

- What factors make a planet potentially habitable?
- Why is distance from a star useful but not sufficient evidence?
- How do scientists make claims when they cannot directly visit the system being studied?

## Activity Sequence

### Dataset review

Students sort planetary data into categories such as "supports liquid water," "insufficient evidence," and "unlikely to support life." They justify each placement.

### Habitable zone reasoning

Students compare star type and orbital distance to explore why habitable zones vary across systems. They critique the oversimplified idea that one distance always means "just right."

### Claim and uncertainty

Students write a recommendation about which candidate world deserves further investigation and explain what additional evidence would be needed before stronger claims could be made.

## Assessment

This task aligns with **MYP Criterion D**. Students interpret unfamiliar data, apply conceptual understanding to a new context, and evaluate the certainty of their own conclusions.

> **Teaching Tip:** Push students to separate "interesting" from "well-supported." That distinction sharpens both scientific reasoning and written claims.
