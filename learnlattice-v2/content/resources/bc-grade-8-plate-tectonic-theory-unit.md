## Overview

Students examine why plate tectonic theory became accepted and how it explains patterns in Earth processes. The emphasis is on theory-building from evidence rather than receiving the theory as a finished fact.

## BC Curriculum Focus

- Big idea: Plate tectonic theory explains many geological events and features of Earth's surface.
- BC content links: tectonic theory, fossil and seafloor evidence, boundary interactions, and hazard implications.

## Inquiry Questions

**Factual:** What makes a scientific theory powerful?

**Conceptual:** Why did some evidence for continental movement become persuasive only later?

**Debatable:** How should scientific risk information shape public action in tectonic regions?

## Learning Flow

- Compare early and modern evidence for continental movement.
- Use mapping and data interpretation to test what plate tectonic theory explains well.
- End with a civic communication task on tectonic risk and preparedness.

## Assessment Alignment

Students engage **MYP Criterion B** by constructing evidence-based explanations and **Criterion D** by applying theory to hazard communication and community decisions.

> **Teaching Tip:** Historical science works well here. Let students feel why the theory was debated before it was accepted.
