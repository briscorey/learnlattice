## Overview

Students investigate how body systems work together to keep multicellular organisms alive. The unit begins with puzzling case studies about exercise, nutrition, and organ failure, then moves into model-building and evidence-based explanations of internal systems.

## BC Curriculum Focus

- Big idea: Multicellular organisms rely on internal systems to survive, reproduce, and interact with their environment.
- BC content links: basic structures and functions of body systems, relationships between structure and function, and personal choices that affect health.

## Inquiry Questions

**Factual:** How do organs and tissues work together inside a multicellular organism?

**Conceptual:** Why do body systems need coordination rather than isolated parts?

**Debatable:** How much can lifestyle choices change the performance of body systems?

## Learning Flow

- Launch with a performance mystery using pulse, breathing rate, and energy demands during exercise.
- Model digestive, respiratory, and circulatory interactions through station-based evidence tasks.
- Design a health recommendation product where students justify one behaviour change using system evidence.

## Assessment Alignment

The core assessment targets **MYP Criterion B** through model-based inquiry and **Criterion D** through a health decision brief grounded in evidence.

> **Teaching Tip:** Keep anatomy diagrams secondary to systems thinking. Students should explain interactions before memorising every labelled part.
