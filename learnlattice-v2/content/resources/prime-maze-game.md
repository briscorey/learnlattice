## How to Use This Game

**Prime Maze** is a 3D top-down maze game where students navigate levels by collecting prime or composite numbers. Four scaffolded levels build from small primes to larger composite numbers with more branching paths.

### Controls

- **WASD** or **arrow keys** to move
- **Shift** to sprint
- **Touch controls** available on mobile

### What Students Learn

- Distinguish prime numbers from composite numbers
- Apply divisibility reasoning at speed
- Recognise patterns across number ranges

## MYP Connection

Supports **Criterion A (Knowing and Understanding)** — factual recall of number properties — and **Criterion B (Investigating Patterns)** when students compare strategies across levels.

## Classroom Use

- Warm-up before a factors or divisibility lesson
- Pair with a justification sheet: students write why each collected number was prime or composite
- Let students compare strategies: trial division, skip-even shortcut, or factor-pair checking
