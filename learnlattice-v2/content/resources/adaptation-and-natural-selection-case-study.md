## Overview

This case study introduces natural selection through a structured evidence set. Students examine a population facing environmental change, identify which traits affect survival, and distinguish adaptation from short-term response.

## Evidence Set

- Population trait data across several generations
- Environmental change timeline
- Survival and reproduction records
- Competing student explanations to critique

## Learning Sequence

### Step 1: Identifying useful variation

Students analyse which inherited variations are present in a population and decide which could matter under a new environmental pressure.

### Step 2: Explaining selection

Using the evidence set, students write a chain-of-reasoning explanation showing how certain traits become more common over time.

### Step 3: Challenging misconceptions

Students evaluate statements such as "organisms adapt because they need to" and rewrite them using more accurate evolutionary reasoning.

## Assessment

The final task aligns with **MYP Criterion D**. Students produce an evidence-based explanation of how environmental change can shift a population over generations while acknowledging what the data does not prove.

> **Teaching Tip:** Keep the first example concrete and local if possible. Students reason more accurately about selection when the context is specific rather than abstract.
