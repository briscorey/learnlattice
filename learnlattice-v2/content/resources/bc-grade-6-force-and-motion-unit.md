## Overview

Students build explanations for motion by testing pushes, pulls, friction, and inertia in simple systems. Rather than beginning with formulas, they start with prediction, video evidence, and competing explanations.

## BC Curriculum Focus

- Big idea: Newton's laws describe the relationship between force and motion.
- BC content links: balanced and unbalanced forces, gravity, friction, and the effects of force on moving objects.

## Inquiry Questions

**Factual:** What changes motion: force itself or the balance of forces?

**Conceptual:** Why do moving objects appear to need a constant push in everyday life?

**Debatable:** When is a simple classroom model of force useful, and when does it hide too much?

## Learning Flow

- Use carts, ramps, and slow-motion clips to separate observations from assumptions.
- Represent forces with diagrams and revise explanations after friction-focused trials.
- Design a safety or sports application where students use Newtonian reasoning to explain motion outcomes.

## Assessment Alignment

Assessment emphasizes **MYP Criterion B** for investigation planning and **Criterion C** for processing motion data, diagrams, and evidence-based conclusions.

> **Teaching Tip:** Ask students to compare idealised physics with real surfaces and materials so friction becomes a conceptual tool instead of an exception.
