## Overview

This observation resource helps students connect what they see in the sky with the geometry of the Earth-moon-sun system. Students track patterns over time, then explain why phases and eclipses are related but not the same phenomenon.

## Observation Cycle

### Log 1: Night-sky pattern tracking

Students record moon shape, position, and time over multiple days. They identify repeating patterns and compare their observations with an idealised lunar cycle.

### Log 2: Building a phase model

Using lamps and spheres, students test explanations for why the visible portion of the moon changes. They contrast "shadow on the moon" explanations with illumination-based models.

### Log 3: Explaining eclipses

Students model eclipse conditions and explain why eclipses do not happen every month. The focus is on alignment and orbital relationships rather than memorised definitions.

## Assessment

This resource supports **MYP Criterion C** through observation records, annotated diagrams, and a written explanation that distinguishes phases from eclipses using evidence.

> **Teaching Tip:** Preserve inaccurate first explanations before correcting them. Students often learn more when they can compare a misconception with a better model they built themselves.
