## Overview

Students connect rational-number representations through benchmarks, visuals, and context problems. The goal is to see fractions, decimals, and percent as related ways of thinking about quantity, not separate topics.

## BC Curriculum Focus

- BC big idea: Multiple relationships exist among fractions, decimals, whole numbers, and percent.
- BC content links: equivalence, comparison, order, and operations in meaningful contexts.

## Inquiry Questions

**Factual:** Why might one number representation be more useful than another?

**Conceptual:** How do visual and symbolic representations support each other?

**Debatable:** Is percent always the clearest way to communicate comparison?

## Learning Flow

- Compare benchmark quantities using fraction strips, grids, and number lines.
- Translate across forms while solving discount, data, and sharing contexts.
- Conclude with a consumer or survey task requiring justified representation choices.

## Assessment Alignment

The unit pairs **MYP Criterion A** with **Criterion D**, asking students to apply rational-number relationships to everyday contexts and explain their decisions clearly.

> **Teaching Tip:** Keep equivalent forms anchored in the same quantity so students are not just converting symbols.
