## Overview

Students build, graph, and interpret linear relationships from contextual data. The emphasis is on connecting rate of change and starting value to meaning in a situation.

## BC Curriculum Focus

- BC big idea: Linear relationships allow us to model and compare change.
- BC content links: graphing, rate of change, intercepts, tables, equations, and pattern-based generalization.

## Inquiry Questions

**Factual:** What does slope mean beyond a line on a graph?

**Conceptual:** How do equations, tables, and graphs tell the same story differently?

**Debatable:** When is a linear model useful even if reality is more complex?

## Learning Flow

- Generate tables from contexts and infer constant rate.
- Move among graph, equation, and verbal descriptions of the same relationship.
- Finish with a modelling task using authentic data and a recommendation.

## Assessment Alignment

This unit combines **MYP Criterion B** exploration with **Criterion D** application to real data and context-based interpretation.

> **Teaching Tip:** Always ask what the intercept means. It prevents graph work from becoming purely procedural.
