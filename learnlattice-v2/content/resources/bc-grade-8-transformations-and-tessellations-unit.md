## Overview

Students investigate how transformations preserve and change figures. They use geometric reasoning to create tessellations, analyze symmetry, and justify design decisions mathematically.

## BC Curriculum Focus

- BC big idea: Shape and space can be described and analyzed through transformations.
- BC content links: congruence, translations, reflections, rotations, tessellations, and symmetry.

## Inquiry Questions

**Factual:** What does a transformation preserve?

**Conceptual:** Why do some shapes tessellate while others do not?

**Debatable:** How can mathematics guide an artistic or architectural design?

## Learning Flow

- Test congruence and symmetry through dynamic and paper-based tasks.
- Analyze how transformations generate patterns and tilings.
- Finish with a design brief requiring a justified tessellation or visual system.

## Assessment Alignment

The culminating task links **MYP Criterion B** inquiry and **Criterion D** application by requiring mathematics to support a purposeful design choice.

> **Teaching Tip:** Have students predict failure cases. The non-tessellating attempts teach as much as the successful ones.
