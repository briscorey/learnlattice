## Key Vocabulary — Match Before You Start

Before working through the questions, match each term to its definition.

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| Allele | |
| Dominant | |
| Recessive | |
| Genotype | |
| Phenotype | |
| Homozygous | |
| Heterozygous | |

**Definitions (cut and match):**
- The observable characteristic of an organism (e.g., brown eyes)
- An allele that is only expressed when no dominant allele is present
- An organism with two different alleles for a trait (e.g., Bb)
- The genetic make-up of an organism (e.g., BB or Bb)
- An allele that masks the recessive allele when present
- One version of a gene
- An organism with two identical alleles for a trait (e.g., BB or bb)

## Part 1 — Dominant and Recessive Alleles

**Convention:** We use **capital letters** for dominant alleles and **lowercase** for recessive alleles.

**Q1.** In pea plants, tall (T) is dominant over short (t).

Fill in the table:

| Genotype | Homozygous or Heterozygous? | Phenotype |
|----------|----------------------------|-----------|
| TT | | |
| Tt | | |
| tt | | |

---

**Q2.** A cat has black fur (B, dominant) or white fur (b, recessive).

a) Write the genotype of a **homozygous dominant** black cat: \_\_\_\_\_

b) Write the genotype of a **heterozygous** black cat: \_\_\_\_\_

c) Write the genotype of a white cat: \_\_\_\_\_

d) Can you tell from looking at a black cat whether it is BB or Bb? Explain.

*Answer:*

## Part 2 — Punnett Squares

A **Punnett square** predicts the possible genotypes of offspring from a cross between two parents.

### How to complete a Punnett square:
1. Write one parent's alleles across the top (one per column)
2. Write the other parent's alleles down the side (one per row)
3. Fill each box by combining the alleles from that row and column

### Worked Example

> Cross: Tt × Tt (two heterozygous tall pea plants)

```
       T        t
T  |  TT   |   Tt  |
t  |  Tt   |   tt  |
```

Results: 1 TT : 2 Tt : 1 tt → **3 tall : 1 short** (3:1 ratio)

---

**Q3.** Complete the Punnett square for a cross between a **homozygous black cat (BB)** and a **white cat (bb)**.

```
          b        b
B  |         |         |
B  |         |         |
```

a) List all possible genotypes of the offspring: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

b) What is the probability of a black kitten? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ %

c) What is the probability of a white kitten? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ %

---

**Q4.** Complete the Punnett square for **Bb × Bb** (two heterozygous black cats).

```
          B        b
B  |         |         |
b  |         |         |
```

a) What are the expected genotype ratios? \_\_\_ BB : \_\_\_ Bb : \_\_\_ bb

b) What are the expected **phenotype** ratios? \_\_\_ black : \_\_\_ white

c) Out of 80 kittens expected from many such crosses, how many would you predict to be white?

*Answer:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ kittens

---

**Q5.** In humans, having a widow's peak hairline (W) is dominant over a straight hairline (w).

A woman with a widow's peak (Ww) and a man with a straight hairline have children.

a) Complete the Punnett square.

```
          W        w
w  |         |         |
w  |         |         |
```

b) What fraction of children are expected to have a widow's peak? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

c) What fraction are expected to have a straight hairline? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

d) If the couple has 4 children, how many would you expect to have a widow's peak?

*Answer:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (Note: explain why the actual number might differ)

## Part 3 — Blood Types

Human blood type is determined by multiple alleles: **Iᴬ**, **Iᴮ**, and **i**. Iᴬ and Iᴮ are **codominant** (both expressed) and both dominant over i.

| Blood Type | Possible Genotypes |
|------------|-------------------|
| A | IᴬIᴬ or Iᴬi |
| B | IᴮIᴮ or Iᴮi |
| AB | IᴬIᴮ |
| O | ii |

**Q6.** A mother with blood type A (genotype Iᴬi) and a father with blood type B (genotype Iᴮi) have children.

a) Complete the Punnett square.

```
          Iᴬ        i
Iᴮ  |         |         |
i   |         |         |
```

b) What is the probability of each blood type in their children?

| Blood Type | Genotype(s) | Probability |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| A | | |
| B | | |
| AB | | |
| O | | |

c) Is it possible for a child of these parents to have blood type O? Explain.

*Answer:*

---

**Q7.** A child has blood type O. Their mother has blood type A.

a) What must the child's genotype be? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

b) What must the mother's genotype be? Explain your reasoning.

*Answer:*

c) What possible blood types could the father have? (More than one answer may be possible)

*Answer:*

## Part 4 — Genetic Diseases

**Cystic Fibrosis (CF)** is caused by a recessive allele (f). A person only has CF if they inherit **two** recessive alleles (ff). People with one dominant and one recessive allele (Ff) are called **carriers** — they don't have the disease but can pass the allele to their children.

**Q8.** Two carrier parents (Ff × Ff) are expecting a child.

a) Complete the Punnett square.

```
          F        f
F  |         |         |
f  |         |         |
```

b) What is the probability that the child:

- Has cystic fibrosis: \_\_\_\_\_\_ %
- Is a carrier: \_\_\_\_\_\_ %
- Is unaffected and not a carrier: \_\_\_\_\_\_ %

c) The parents are told "there's a 25% chance your child will have CF." They already have one child without CF. A friend says "so the next child definitely won't have CF because the odds reset." Is the friend correct? Explain.

*Answer:*

## Part 5 — Extension: Sex-Linked Traits

Some traits are carried on the **X chromosome**. Males (XY) only have one X chromosome, so even a recessive allele on the X chromosome is expressed in males.

**Colour blindness** is caused by a recessive allele on the X chromosome. We write it as: Xᴮ (normal vision, dominant) and Xᵇ (colour blind, recessive).

**Q9.** A carrier female (XᴮXᵇ) and a normal-sighted male (XᴮY) have children.

a) Complete the Punnett square.

```
          Xᴮ        Xᵇ
Xᴮ  |         |         |
Y   |         |         |
```

b) What is the probability of a **colour blind son**? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

c) What is the probability of a **colour blind daughter**? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

d) Why are males more commonly colour blind than females?

*Answer:*

## Reflection

**Q10.** A couple is told by a genetic counsellor that they each carry a recessive allele for a serious disease. They are trying to decide whether to have children. What information from this worksheet would help them understand their situation? What factors beyond genetics should they also consider?
