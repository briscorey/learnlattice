## Overview

This resource helps students compare photosynthesis and cellular respiration as linked processes rather than separate chapters. Students trace the movement of matter and energy through diagrams, data tables, and short written explanations.

## Focus Questions

- How are photosynthesis and respiration connected?
- What role do chloroplasts and mitochondria play in energy transfer?
- Why do matter and energy need to be described differently in biology?

## Task Flow

### Part A: Sorting claims

Students categorise common statements about energy, oxygen, glucose, and carbon dioxide as correct, incomplete, or misleading. This quickly exposes misconceptions before formal explanation begins.

### Part B: Diagram annotation

Students annotate paired diagrams of chloroplasts and mitochondria, then use arrows and labels to show where matter enters, changes, and leaves each process.

### Part C: System explanation

Students explain how plant cells can perform both processes and why this matters for survival. The final prompt asks them to connect cell processes to the larger cycling of matter in ecosystems.

## Assessment Opportunity

This task targets **MYP Criterion C** through scientific communication. Students create a comparison response that includes accurate vocabulary, annotated visual models, and a short paragraph explaining the relationship between both processes.

> **Teaching Tip:** Ask students to explain why plants still respire at night. That question usually forces a more complete systems explanation.
