## The Three Laws — Quick Reference

| Law | Statement | Key Idea |
|-----|-----------|----------|
| **1st Law** (Inertia) | An object remains at rest or moves at constant velocity unless acted on by a net force. | Forces change motion — without a force, nothing changes. |
| **2nd Law** (F = ma) | The net force on an object equals its mass times its acceleration. | Bigger force = more acceleration. Bigger mass = less acceleration. |
| **3rd Law** (Action-Reaction) | For every action force there is an equal and opposite reaction force. | Forces always come in pairs. |

## Part 1 — Newton's First Law

### What is Inertia?

Inertia is the tendency of an object to resist changes in its motion. A more massive object has greater inertia — it's harder to start moving, stop, or change direction.

**Q1.** A book sits on a table. List all the forces acting on it and explain why it doesn't move.

*Answer:*

---

**Q2.** A spacecraft travelling in deep space (far from any planets or stars) turns off its engines. Describe what happens to the spacecraft and explain *why* using Newton's First Law.

*Answer:*

---

**Q3.** You are in a car that brakes suddenly. Explain why your body lunges forward, using the concept of inertia. Why does a seatbelt help?

*Answer:*

---

**Q4.** Identify whether each situation involves Newton's 1st Law. Circle **Yes** or **No** and write one sentence of justification.

| Situation | 1st Law? | Justification |
|-----------|----------|---------------|
| A ball rolls along a frictionless surface forever | Yes / No | |
| A skydiver accelerates when jumping from a plane | Yes / No | |
| A satellite orbits at constant speed | Yes / No | |
| A parked car stays still | Yes / No | |

## Part 2 — Newton's Second Law: F = ma

### Units
- Force (F) → Newtons (N)
- Mass (m) → kilograms (kg)
- Acceleration (a) → metres per second squared (m/s²)

### Worked Example

> A 5 kg box is pushed with a net force of 20 N. What is its acceleration?

F = ma → a = F/m = 20 ÷ 5 = **4 m/s²**

---

**Q5.** Calculate the missing quantity in each row. Show your formula rearrangement.

| Force (N) | Mass (kg) | Acceleration (m/s²) |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| 30 | 6 | ? |
| ? | 4 | 5 |
| 48 | ? | 8 |
| 100 | 25 | ? |
| ? | 12 | 3 |

**Q6.** A car of mass 1200 kg accelerates from rest to 20 m/s in 8 seconds.

a) Calculate the acceleration of the car.

*Working:*

*Answer:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ m/s²

b) Calculate the net force required to produce this acceleration.

*Working:*

*Answer:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ N

c) In reality, the engine produces 8000 N of force. What does this tell you about other forces acting on the car?

*Answer:*

---

**Q7.** Two identical rockets are launched. Rocket A has mass 200 kg and produces 4000 N of thrust. Rocket B has mass 400 kg and produces 4000 N of thrust.

a) Calculate the acceleration of each rocket. Ignore gravity for this question.

Rocket A: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ m/s²

Rocket B: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ m/s²

b) Which rocket reaches a higher speed first? Explain why.

*Answer:*

---

**Q8. Net Force**

Not all forces push in the same direction. The *net force* is the overall combined force.

Two people push a sofa. Person A pushes right with 80 N. Person B pushes left with 50 N. The sofa has a mass of 30 kg.

a) Draw a force diagram showing the two forces.

b) Calculate the net force. State its direction.

*Net Force:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ N to the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

c) Calculate the acceleration of the sofa.

*Answer:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ m/s²

## Part 3 — Newton's Third Law

### Key Concept

Action and reaction forces:
- Are **equal in size** and **opposite in direction**
- Act on **different objects** (not the same one)
- Happen **at the same time**

---

**Q9.** For each action force, write the reaction force and identify which object it acts on.

| Situation | Action Force | Reaction Force | Acts On |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|---------|
| You push a wall | You push the wall | | |
| A rocket expels gas downward | Gas pushed down | | |
| A swimmer's hand pushes water backward | Hand pushes water back | | |
| Earth's gravity pulls you down | | | |

**Q10.** A person stands on a skateboard and throws a heavy ball forward.

a) What happens to the person on the skateboard? Use Newton's 3rd Law to explain.

*Answer:*

b) If the person throws the ball harder, how does this affect what happens to the person? Why?

*Answer:*

---

**Q11.** A common misconception is: "If action and reaction forces are equal and opposite, they should cancel out — so nothing should ever move." Explain why this reasoning is **wrong**.

*(Hint: think about which objects the forces act on)*

*Answer:*

---

## Part 4 — Applied Problems

**Q12. The Elevator Problem**

A person of mass 70 kg stands on a scale in an elevator. The scale measures the normal force in Newtons.

a) The elevator is stationary. What does the scale read? (g = 10 m/s²)

*Working:*

*Answer:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ N

b) The elevator accelerates upward at 2 m/s². What does the scale read?

*(Hint: Net force = ma, and Net force = Scale − Weight)*

*Working:*

*Answer:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ N

c) The elevator accelerates downward at 2 m/s². What does the scale read?

*Answer:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ N

d) The elevator is in free fall (cable snapped). What does the scale read? What does this feel like?

*Answer:*

---

**Q13. Investigation Design**

You want to verify Newton's Second Law experimentally using a trolley on a ramp, some hanging masses, and a motion sensor.

a) Write a clear hypothesis for the relationship between force and acceleration.

*Hypothesis:*

b) Identify the **independent**, **dependent**, and **control** variables.

| Variable Type | What it is in this experiment |
|--------------|-------------------------------|
| Independent | |
| Dependent | |
| Control (at least 3) | |

c) What graph would you draw to test your hypothesis? What would a straight line through the origin tell you?

*Answer:*

## Reflection Questions

**Q14.** Which of Newton's three laws do you find most difficult to understand? Explain what confuses you and what you think might help.

**Q15.** Newton developed these laws in 1687. For most of history they worked perfectly. Then Einstein came along. Research: In what situation do Newton's laws break down, and what replaced them?
