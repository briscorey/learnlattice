## Overview

Students move from noticing pattern growth to expressing general rules with words, tables, and symbols. The unit introduces algebra as a language for structure and prediction rather than as isolated notation.

## BC Curriculum Focus

- BC big idea: Patterns and relationships can be represented in multiple ways.
- BC content links: variables, one-step relationships, tables, expressions, and growing pattern analysis.

## Inquiry Questions

**Factual:** What makes a pattern explanation convincing?

**Conceptual:** Why do mathematicians use variables instead of continuing a table forever?

**Debatable:** When is a visual model stronger than a symbolic rule?

## Learning Flow

- Investigate growing visual patterns and justify how they change.
- Represent the same relationship using words, tables, and expressions.
- End with a student-created pattern museum where each display includes a general rule and defense.

## Assessment Alignment

This unit targets **MYP Criterion B** through pattern investigations and **Criterion C** through clear communication of generalisation and symbolic reasoning.

> **Teaching Tip:** Push students to explain why their rule always works, not just which outputs it generates.
