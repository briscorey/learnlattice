## Overview

Students explain visible changes in matter by linking them to particle motion and system cycling. They move from observing phase changes to tracing matter through water, carbon, and local environmental systems.

## BC Curriculum Focus

- Big idea: Matter cycles within ecosystems and Earth systems.
- BC content links: kinetic molecular theory, states of matter, physical change, and the cycling of matter through natural systems.

## Inquiry Questions

**Factual:** How does an invisible particle model explain visible change?

**Conceptual:** What does it mean to say matter cycles instead of disappearing?

**Debatable:** When do simplified particle diagrams help, and when do they distort?

## Learning Flow

- Observe state changes and build particle explanations from evidence.
- Trace matter through environmental cycles using local examples.
- Finish with a systems poster or explanation task that links particle theory to a large-scale cycle.

## Assessment Alignment

The unit is built around **MYP Criterion B** for model testing and **Criterion C** for representing, processing, and evaluating evidence from particle and systems data.

> **Teaching Tip:** Keep students translating back and forth between macro observations and particle explanations.
