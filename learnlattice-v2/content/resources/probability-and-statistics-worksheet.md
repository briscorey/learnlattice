## Quick Reference

| Measure | Formula | When to use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Mean | Sum of all values ÷ number of values | Balanced datasets, no extreme outliers |
| Median | Middle value when sorted | Skewed data or outliers present |
| Mode | Most frequent value | Categorical data, most common value |
| Range | Largest − Smallest | Simple measure of spread |
| IQR | Q3 − Q1 | Better measure of spread (ignores extremes) |

**Probability:** P(event) = number of favourable outcomes ÷ total number of outcomes

b) How many combinations are there? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

c) If a student picks randomly, P(Chicken and Cake) = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

d) P(Vegetarian and not Cake) = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

## Part 3 — Measures of Centre and Spread

**Dataset A:** Test scores for Class 8B

78, 65, 82, 91, 74, 68, 85, 77, 60, 88, 73, 82, 79, 95, 71

**Q6.** Using Dataset A:

a) Sort the data from smallest to largest.

b) Calculate the **mean**. Show your working.

*Q1 = \_\_\_\_\_ Q3 = \_\_\_\_\_*

g) Calculate the **IQR**.

*IQR = Q3 − Q1 = \_\_\_\_\_*

---

**Q7.** Two more students joined the class. One scored 45, the other scored 99.

a) Without calculating, predict whether the mean or median will change more. Explain your reasoning.

*Answer:*

b) Calculate the new mean and compare it to the original.

*New mean:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

c) Calculate the new median.

*New median:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

d) Which measure of centre (mean or median) better represents the "typical" student in this class now? Explain.

*Answer:*

## Part 4 — Interpreting Real Data

**The table below shows average monthly rainfall (mm) and average temperature (°C) in Nanjing, China.**

| Month | Rainfall (mm) | Temperature (°C) |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| Jan | 40 | 3 |
| Feb | 48 | 5 |
| Mar | 62 | 10 |
| Apr | 84 | 17 |
| May | 94 | 22 |
| Jun | 145 | 27 |

| Aug | 132 | 31 |
| Sep | 72 | 26 |
| Oct | 55 | 20 |
| Nov | 48 | 12 |
| Dec | 36 | 5 |

## Part 5 — Box Plots

**Q10.** Draw a box plot for the test score data from Q6 (original 15 values).

Use these values:
- Minimum: \_\_\_\_\_\_
- Q1: \_\_\_\_\_\_
- Median: \_\_\_\_\_\_
- Q3: \_\_\_\_\_\_
- Maximum: \_\_\_\_\_\_

*Draw your box plot here:*

```
50        60        70        80        90       100
|         |         |         |         |         |
```

## Part 6 — Probability Challenge

**Q12.** In a game show, there are 3 doors. Behind one door is a car; behind the other two are goats. You pick Door 1. The host (who knows what's behind each door) opens Door 3 to reveal a goat.

You can stay with Door 1 or switch to Door 2.

a) If you **stay** with Door 1, what is the probability of winning the car?

*Answer:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

b) If you **switch** to Door 2, what do you think the probability is of winning? Explain your intuitive answer first.

*Intuitive answer:*

c) This famous problem (the Monty Hall problem) has a surprising answer. Research or reason through why switching actually gives you a 2/3 chance of winning. Write your best explanation.

*Explanation:*

## Reflection

**Q13.** In statistics, we often say "correlation does not imply causation." Using the Nanjing data or any other example, explain what this phrase means and why it matters when interpreting data.
