## Overview

Students use measurement as a design tool to compare shapes, coverings, and layouts. They investigate why formulas work and when measurement decisions affect cost, efficiency, or practicality.

## BC Curriculum Focus

- BC big idea: Geometry and measurement allow us to describe, build, and compare objects in space.
- BC content links: area, perimeter, surface area, nets, and standard units in practical contexts.

## Inquiry Questions

**Factual:** How do formulas compress geometric thinking without replacing it?

**Conceptual:** Why can two shapes share perimeter but not area, or area but not surface needs?

**Debatable:** What makes a measurement decision mathematically and practically sound?

## Learning Flow

- Model area and perimeter through tiles, sketches, and redesign challenges.
- Investigate nets and surface area using packaging or room-design tasks.
- Conclude with an optimisation challenge tied to material use or coverage.

## Assessment Alignment

The culminating task blends **MYP Criterion B** design and **Criterion D** application by requiring a justified measurement solution to a real constraint.

> **Teaching Tip:** Have students estimate material use first. It keeps the formulas connected to physical meaning.
