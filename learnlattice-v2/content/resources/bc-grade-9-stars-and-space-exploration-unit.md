## Overview

Students explore how scientists infer the structure and history of the universe from light and motion evidence. The unit combines star patterns, stellar life cycles, and space exploration technologies with model critique.

## BC Curriculum Focus

- Big idea: The universe is made of stars, galaxies, and other matter organized across vast scales.
- BC content links: stars, galaxies, apparent brightness, light as evidence, and technologies that extend human understanding of space.

## Inquiry Questions

**Factual:** How can light tell us about objects we cannot touch or visit?

**Conceptual:** Why do models of the universe change as new evidence appears?

**Debatable:** How should societies justify spending on space exploration?

## Learning Flow

- Interpret star colour, brightness, and distance through observation data.
- Compare models of stellar life cycles and cosmic scale.
- Conclude with a public-facing proposal or debate about a space mission grounded in evidence and impact.

## Assessment Alignment

Students use **MYP Criterion B** to interrogate evidence and models and **Criterion D** to apply astronomical concepts to decisions about exploration and technology.

> **Teaching Tip:** Use uncertainty language explicitly. Space science is a strong place to teach confidence, limits, and revision.
