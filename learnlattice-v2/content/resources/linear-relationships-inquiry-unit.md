## Overview

This inquiry unit guides students through the discovery of linear relationships using real-world data and contexts. Students move from pattern recognition to formal algebraic representation, building deep conceptual understanding of gradient, y-intercept, and the connections between tables, graphs, and equations.

## Key Understandings

Students will understand that:
- Linear relationships can be represented in multiple ways (table, graph, equation, context)
- The gradient describes the rate of change in a relationship
- The y-intercept represents the starting value in a context

## Inquiry Questions

**Factual:** What is a linear equation? How do we calculate gradient?

**Conceptual:** Why can the same relationship be shown in different ways? How does changing one representation affect the others?

**Debatable:** Is a mathematical model ever a perfect representation of reality?

## Assessment

This unit targets **MYP Criterion C** (Communicating) and **Criterion D** (Applying mathematics in real-life contexts). Students complete a summative task analysing real data sets and communicating their findings.

## Lesson Sequence

The unit runs over approximately 3 weeks (15 lessons) and follows a gradual release model from guided inquiry to independent investigation.

> **Teaching Tip:** Begin with a concrete context students can relate to — mobile phone plans, taxi fares, or plant growth data work well. Let students discover the pattern before introducing formal notation.
