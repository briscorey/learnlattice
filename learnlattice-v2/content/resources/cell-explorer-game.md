## How to Use This Game

**Cell Explorer** is a fully interactive animal cell you can explore, quiz yourself on, and build from scratch. Switch between three modes using the tabs at the top.

### Three Modes

**🔬 Explore** — Click any part of the cell to learn its name, function, real-world analogy, and a surprising fact. Hover to highlight organelles, click to lock in.

**🧠 Quiz** — A random organelle glows and you identify it from four options. 10 questions per round, scored live. Start here after you've explored.

**🏗️ Build** — Drag organelles from the sidebar and drop them onto the correct location inside the cell. Build the complete cell to win.

## Organelles in This Game

| Organelle | Function |
|-----------|---------|
| Cell Membrane | Controls what enters and exits the cell |
| Nucleus | Control centre — contains DNA |
| Mitochondria | Produces ATP energy |
| Rough ER | Manufactures and folds proteins |
| Golgi Apparatus | Sorts and ships proteins |
| Ribosomes | Builds proteins from amino acids |
| Lysosomes | Digests waste and foreign material |
| Vacuole | Stores water and nutrients |
| Centrosome | Organises cell division |
| Cytoplasm | Fluid medium for all reactions |

## MYP Connection

This game supports **Criterion A (Knowing and Understanding)** by developing factual knowledge of organelle names and functions. After exploring the game, students should be able to:

- Name at least 8 organelles in an animal cell
- Describe the function of each organelle in their own words
- Explain how organelles work together as a system
- Use real-world analogies to explain cell structure to others

## What to Do Next

After mastering the game, check out the **[Photosynthesis and Cellular Respiration Worksheet](/resources/photosynthesis-cellular-respiration-worksheet/)** to connect organelle function to energy systems, or the **[Biodiversity and Classification Worksheet](/resources/biodiversity-and-classification-worksheet/)** for broader biology contexts.
