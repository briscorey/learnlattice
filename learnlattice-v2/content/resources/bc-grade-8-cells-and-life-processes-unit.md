## Overview

Students use microscopy, modelling, and comparative reasoning to explain how cells carry out life processes. The work links cell structures to transport, energy, and specialised function rather than treating organelles as isolated vocabulary.

## BC Curriculum Focus

- Big idea: Cells are a basic unit of life.
- BC content links: cell theory, types of cells, microscopes, and the relationship between cell structures and essential life processes.

## Inquiry Questions

**Factual:** What makes a cell the basic unit of life rather than just a tiny structure?

**Conceptual:** How do models help us think about things we cannot see directly?

**Debatable:** Is a labelled diagram enough to show understanding in cell biology?

## Learning Flow

- Observe cells and compare direct observation with textbook representations.
- Investigate transport, specialization, and life processes using model-based tasks.
- Culminate in a scientific explanation that connects cell structure, evidence, and life function.

## Assessment Alignment

Assessment focuses on **MYP Criterion B** for investigation design and **Criterion C** for microscope records, evidence organisation, and explanation quality.

> **Teaching Tip:** Have students compare what they actually saw under the microscope with what they expected to see. That gap creates better questions.
