## Overview

Students use evidence and models to understand why atomic theory and periodic organisation matter. Rather than only naming parts of the atom, they interpret how models explain bonding, reactivity, and material properties.

## BC Curriculum Focus

- Big idea: Elements are made of atoms, and atoms combine to form compounds.
- BC content links: atomic theory, elements, compounds, periodic table patterns, and evidence for how substances are classified and explained.

## Inquiry Questions

**Factual:** Why do scientists keep revising atomic models?

**Conceptual:** How do periodic patterns help us predict what we have not tested directly?

**Debatable:** How much trust should we place in models of things we cannot see?

## Learning Flow

- Compare historical and modern atomic models using evidence cards.
- Classify substances and infer patterns from periodic data.
- Finish with a material-selection or mystery-substance task requiring justified predictions.

## Assessment Alignment

The unit links **MYP Criterion B** to evidence-based model building and **Criterion D** to using periodic patterns in unfamiliar, practical contexts.

> **Teaching Tip:** Keep periodic trends tied to prediction tasks so the table feels like a reasoning tool, not a poster to decode.
