## Overview

This inquiry unit introduces space science through the interplay of force, motion, and scale. Students use physical models, observation records, and planetary data to explain orbits, seasonal changes, and why many common space misconceptions persist.

## Driving Questions

**Factual:** What causes planets and moons to stay in orbit? Why do seasons change over the year?

**Conceptual:** How do scientists study systems that are too large and distant to test directly? What makes a model useful in science?

**Debatable:** Do classroom models of the solar system clarify understanding, or do they create new misconceptions?

## Lesson Arc

### Lesson Set 1: Gravity and motion

Students analyse motion demonstrations and simulations to describe how gravitational attraction shapes orbital paths. They compare straight-line motion with curved motion caused by a central force.

### Lesson Set 2: Earth-sun relationships

Using lamp-and-globe models plus seasonal daylight data, students investigate why tilt matters more than distance from the sun. They test and revise explanations for summer and winter in different hemispheres.

### Lesson Set 3: Scale and representation

Students build a scale model of the solar system and critique its limitations. They examine which features can be modelled well and which features, such as distance and time, are often distorted.

## Assessment Integration

This unit emphasises **MYP Criterion B** with an extension into **Criterion D**. Students design a short model-based explanation task in which they defend the usefulness and limits of one representation of the Earth-sun-moon system.

> **Teaching Tip:** Ask students to predict what a model will get wrong before using it. That shift makes model critique part of the inquiry instead of an afterthought.
