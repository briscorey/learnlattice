## Key Concepts — Quick Reference

| Quantity | Symbol | Unit | Unit Symbol | What it measures |
|----------|--------|------|-------------|-----------------|
| Voltage | V | Volt | V | Energy per unit charge (the "push") |
| Current | I | Ampere | A | Flow of charge (electrons per second) |
| Resistance | R | Ohm | Ω | Opposition to current flow |
| Power | P | Watt | W | Energy transferred per second |

### Ohm's Law
$$V = I \times R$$

Rearranged: $I = V/R$ and $R = V/I$

### Power Formula
$$P = V \times I$$
