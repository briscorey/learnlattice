## Overview

Students extend computational fluency to a broader set of rational numbers while comparing mental, visual, and symbolic strategies. The aim is to build flexible reasoning, not just rule memorization.

## BC Curriculum Focus

- BC big idea: Computational fluency and flexibility extend to operations with rational numbers.
- BC content links: operations with fractions, decimals, and integers in contextual problems.

## Inquiry Questions

**Factual:** How do representations prevent sign and operation errors?

**Conceptual:** Why do rules for integers make sense when modeled well?

**Debatable:** When is an exact answer more useful than a well-justified estimate?

## Learning Flow

- Use number lines and chip models to reason about integer operations.
- Compare fraction and decimal strategies across authentic contexts.
- Finish with a budgeting or game-design task requiring rational-number decisions.

## Assessment Alignment

This unit foregrounds **MYP Criterion A** understanding and **Criterion C** precise explanation, notation, and comparison of strategies.

> **Teaching Tip:** Revisit meaning constantly. Students need operations to stay tied to quantity and direction.
