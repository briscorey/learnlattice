## Overview

This practical sequence helps students connect observable reaction speed to the particle model. Students collect rate data, compare variables, and use collision theory to explain why some reactions proceed more quickly than others.

## Variables Investigated

- Temperature
- Concentration
- Surface area
- Presence of a catalyst

## Lab Sequence

### Lab 1: Baseline rate measurement

Students run a standard reaction and practise timing, controlling variables, and identifying the most reliable endpoint for comparison.

### Lab 2: One variable at a time

Groups investigate a single factor affecting rate, graph their data, and explain results using particle-collision language.

### Lab 3: Interpreting anomalies

Students compare classes' data and discuss why certain trials did not follow the predicted pattern. They identify procedural limitations and suggest improvements.

## Assessment

The labs are designed around **MYP Criterion B**. Students formulate a question, plan a fair test, gather quantitative evidence, and explain how the results support or challenge the collision theory model.

> **Safety Note:** Keep reactions microscale where possible and pre-check any gas-producing setups for pressure risk before student use.
