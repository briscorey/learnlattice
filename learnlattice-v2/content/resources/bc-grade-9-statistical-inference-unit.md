## Overview

Students examine how valid conclusions depend on the quality of the sample and the interpretation. They critique data claims, improve study designs, and defend what a data set can and cannot support.

## BC Curriculum Focus

- BC big idea: Analyzing the validity of samples and conclusions helps us understand data.
- BC content links: sampling methods, bias, interpretation of statistics, and critique of conclusions.

## Inquiry Questions

**Factual:** What makes a sample representative enough to support a claim?

**Conceptual:** How can a mathematically correct graph still be misleading?

**Debatable:** What should responsible communicators say about uncertainty?

## Learning Flow

- Critique sample designs and reconstruct them to reduce bias.
- Compare conclusions drawn from the same data under different assumptions.
- Finish with a research summary in which students defend the validity of their claim.

## Assessment Alignment

Assessment uses **MYP Criterion B** for planning and critiquing data collection and **Criterion C** for clear, honest communication of findings and limits.

> **Teaching Tip:** Normalize answers like “the data is insufficient.” That is good mathematics.
