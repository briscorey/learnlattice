## Overview

Students treat Earth as a changing system and use multiple lines of evidence to explain tectonic activity. Mapping, earthquake data, and rock-pattern evidence push them beyond memorising boundary types.

## BC Curriculum Focus

- Big idea: Earth's crust is dynamic and changes over time.
- BC content links: tectonic plates, earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain building, and evidence that Earth's surface changes through geological processes.

## Inquiry Questions

**Factual:** How do scientists know Earth's crust moves if the motion is so slow?

**Conceptual:** Why are some kinds of evidence stronger than others in geology?

**Debatable:** Can a region be scientifically well understood and still remain unpredictable?

## Learning Flow

- Start with global earthquake and volcano maps to notice patterns.
- Test boundary models against data and revise explanations using cross-sections and timelines.
- End with a risk communication task where students explain a regional tectonic hazard to a public audience.

## Assessment Alignment

Students use **MYP Criterion B** to design and refine tectonic explanations and **Criterion C** to process mapped evidence, diagrams, and geological claims.

> **Teaching Tip:** Keep students comparing evidence sources, not just copying tectonic labels onto a map.
