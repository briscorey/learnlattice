## Overview

Students investigate how data collection methods and display choices shape conclusions. They work with samples, summary measures, and biased presentations to strengthen critical statistical literacy.

## BC Curriculum Focus

- BC big idea: Data can be analyzed to make justified conclusions, but methods affect validity.
- BC content links: sampling, central tendency, graph interpretation, and drawing or critiquing inferences.

## Inquiry Questions

**Factual:** What makes one conclusion more trustworthy than another?

**Conceptual:** How can the same data tell different stories?

**Debatable:** When should we refuse to make a claim from a weak sample?

## Learning Flow

- Analyze existing surveys and identify flaws in collection or display.
- Collect class data and compare measures and graphs for usefulness.
- Conclude with a recommendation task supported by transparent statistical reasoning.

## Assessment Alignment

The unit targets **MYP Criterion B** through statistical inquiry design and **Criterion C** through careful presentation and critique of conclusions.

> **Teaching Tip:** Use real but imperfect data so students must discuss uncertainty, not just calculate averages.
