## Overview

This simulation asks students to predict and test what happens when a species is removed, added, or reduced within a food web. The activity emphasises system interdependence rather than isolated cause-and-effect thinking.

## Core Objectives

- Describe how energy and matter move through a food web
- Identify the role of keystone and producer species
- Predict short-term and long-term consequences of disturbance
- Revise explanations when system feedback produces unexpected outcomes

## Activity Structure

### Round 1: Stable system

Students begin with a balanced food web and explain why populations remain within a manageable range.

### Round 2: Disturbance event

Each group applies a disruption such as drought, disease, invasive species, or predator removal. They predict how other populations will respond before running the simulation.

### Round 3: Recovery and intervention

Students test restoration strategies and decide which intervention best supports long-term stability. They compare solutions and critique unintended side effects.

## Assessment Integration

This activity supports **MYP Criterion B** by asking students to form testable predictions, gather results, and refine explanations based on system behaviour rather than intuition alone.

> **Teaching Tip:** Require students to justify arrows in their food web before discussing disturbances. Weak baseline models lead to weak causal reasoning later.
