## Overview

This resource introduces acids and bases through observable changes, indicator use, and neutralisation reactions. Students investigate pH patterns first, then connect those observations to practical decisions in household, environmental, and industrial contexts.

## Inquiry Focus

**Factual:** What do indicators show? What happens during neutralisation?

**Conceptual:** Why is pH a useful model for comparing substances? How can a reaction be both practical and potentially hazardous?

**Debatable:** Is numerical precision more important than visible evidence when students first learn about acids and bases?

## Investigation Parts

### Part A: Indicator comparison

Students test common substances with universal indicator, litmus, and one natural indicator. They compare the strengths and limits of each method.

### Part B: Neutralisation challenge

Students combine acidic and basic solutions in controlled amounts to reach neutral conditions. They interpret colour changes and explain the reaction using simple symbolic language.

### Part C: Real-world application

Students evaluate one acid-base scenario such as treating a wasp sting, managing soil pH, or neutralising a chemical spill. They decide which evidence matters most for a practical recommendation.

## Assessment

This investigation targets **MYP Criterion C** through labelled observations, explanation of evidence, and a short written recommendation tied to a real-world scenario.

> **Teaching Tip:** Let students compare conflicting indicator results before resolving them. The tension helps them understand that measurement tools have limits.
