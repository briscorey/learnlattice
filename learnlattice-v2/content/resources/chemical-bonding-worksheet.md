## Core Concepts

### Types of Bonding

| Type | Between | How | Results in |
|------|---------|-----|-----------|
| **Ionic** | Metal and non-metal | Transfer of electrons | Ions held by electrostatic attraction |
| **Covalent** | Non-metals | Sharing of electrons | Molecules or giant covalent structures |
| **Metallic** | Metal atoms | Sea of delocalised electrons | Metal lattice |

### Electron Configuration Reminder

Atoms want to achieve a **full outer shell** (like noble gases). They do this by:
- **Losing** electrons → become positive ions (cations)
- **Gaining** electrons → become negative ions (anions)
- **Sharing** electrons → form covalent bonds

## Part 1 — Ions and Ionic Bonding

**Q1.** Complete the table by writing the ion formed and how many electrons are lost or gained.

| Element | Proton Number | Electrons in atom | Electrons gained/lost | Ion formed | Ion symbol |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|-----------------------|-----------|-----------|
| Sodium | 11 | 11 | loses 1 | 2,8 | Na⁺ |
| Magnesium | 12 | 12 | | | |
| Chlorine | 17 | 17 | | | |
| Oxygen | 8 | 8 | | | |
| Calcium | 20 | 20 | | | |
| Fluorine | 9 | 9 | | | |

---

**Q2.** Use your knowledge of ions to predict the formula of each ionic compound.

*Example:* Sodium chloride → Na⁺ and Cl⁻ → NaCl (1:1 ratio, charges balance)

*Example:* Calcium chloride → Ca²⁺ and Cl⁻ → CaCl₂ (one Ca²⁺ balances two Cl⁻)

| Metal Ion | Non-metal Ion | Formula | Explanation |
|-----------|--------------|---------|-------------|
| Na⁺ | O²⁻ | | |
| Mg²⁺ | Cl⁻ | | |
| Al³⁺ | O²⁻ | | |
| Ca²⁺ | F⁻ | | |
| K⁺ | S²⁻ | | |

---

**Q3. Dot-and-Cross Diagrams for Ionic Compounds**

Draw dot-and-cross diagrams to show the electron transfer in the formation of:

**a) Sodium chloride (NaCl)**

Show Na (2,8,1) transferring 1 electron to Cl (2,8,7)

*Draw here — show Na becoming Na⁺ and Cl becoming Cl⁻*

**b) Magnesium oxide (MgO)**

Show Mg (2,8,2) transferring 2 electrons to O (2,6)

*Draw here — show Mg becoming Mg²⁺ and O becoming O²⁻*

---

**Q4.** Explain why ionic compounds have these properties:

a) **High melting points** (e.g., NaCl melts at 801°C)

*Answer:*

b) **Conduct electricity when dissolved in water or melted, but not when solid**

*Answer:*

c) **Brittle — they shatter when struck**

*Answer:*

---

## Part 2 — Covalent Bonding

In covalent bonds, **pairs of electrons are shared** between atoms. Each shared pair counts as one bond.

### Worked Example: Water (H₂O)

Oxygen has 6 outer electrons (needs 2 more). Each hydrogen has 1 outer electron (needs 1 more). Oxygen shares one pair with each hydrogen atom. Result: O has 8 electrons in outer shell ✓, each H has 2 ✓

---

**Q5.** Complete the table for simple covalent molecules.

| Molecule | Formula | Number of bonds | Bonding diagram (describe or draw) |
|----------|---------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|
| Hydrogen gas | H₂ | 1 (single bond) | H—H |
| Chlorine gas | Cl₂ | | |
| Oxygen gas | O₂ | 2 (double bond) | O=O |
| Nitrogen gas | N₂ | | |
| Hydrogen chloride | HCl | | |
| Carbon dioxide | CO₂ | | |
| Methane | CH₄ | | |
| Ammonia | NH₃ | | |

---

**Q6. Dot-and-Cross Diagrams for Covalent Molecules**

Draw dot-and-cross diagrams for the following. Show only outer shell electrons. Use dots for one atom and crosses for the other.

**a) Chlorine (Cl₂)**

Cl has 7 outer electrons. Each Cl needs one more.

*Draw here:*

**b) Water (H₂O)**

*Draw here:*

**c) Ammonia (NH₃)**

N has 5 outer electrons, H has 1.

*Draw here:*

---

**Q7.** Compare the properties of ionic and covalent substances by completing this table:

| Property | Ionic Compounds | Simple Covalent Molecules |
|----------|----------------|--------------------------|
| Melting point | High (example: NaCl 801°C) | |
| Solubility in water | | |
| Electrical conductivity (solid) | | |
| Electrical conductivity (dissolved/liquid) | | |
| Example | Sodium chloride (NaCl) | |

## Part 3 — Writing Chemical Equations

### Word Equations → Symbol Equations

**Rules:**
1. Write correct formulas for all reactants and products
2. Balance the equation (same number of each atom on both sides)
3. Add state symbols: (s) solid, (l) liquid, (g) gas, (aq) dissolved in water

### Worked Example

> "Hydrogen burns in oxygen to make water"

Word equation: hydrogen + oxygen → water

Unbalanced: H₂ + O₂ → H₂O

Balanced: **2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O** ✓ (4 H and 2 O on each side)

---

**Q8.** Balance these equations. Add coefficients only — do not change the formulas.

a) \_\_ Na + \_\_ Cl₂ → \_\_ NaCl

b) \_\_ Mg + \_\_ O₂ → \_\_ MgO

c) \_\_ Al + \_\_ O₂ → \_\_ Al₂O₃

d) \_\_ Fe + \_\_ O₂ → \_\_ Fe₂O₃

e) \_\_ C + \_\_ O₂ → \_\_ CO₂

f) \_\_ CaCO₃ → \_\_ CaO + \_\_ CO₂

g) \_\_ HCl + \_\_ NaOH → \_\_ NaCl + \_\_ H₂O

h) \_\_ H₂SO₄ + \_\_ NaOH → \_\_ Na₂SO₄ + \_\_ H₂O

---

**Q9.** Write the full balanced symbol equation (with state symbols) for each reaction:

a) Sodium reacts with water to produce sodium hydroxide solution and hydrogen gas.

*Answer:*

b) Copper(II) oxide reacts with hydrochloric acid to produce copper(II) chloride solution and water.

*Answer:*

c) Zinc reacts with sulfuric acid to produce zinc sulfate solution and hydrogen gas.

*Answer:*

---

## Part 4 — Ionic Equations

When ionic compounds dissolve in water, they split into separate ions. We can write **ionic equations** that only show the ions that actually change (the **spectator ions** cancel out).

### Worked Example

> HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) → NaCl(aq) + H₂O(l)

Full ionic equation: H⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq) + Na⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq) → Na⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq) + H₂O(l)

Na⁺ and Cl⁻ appear on both sides — they are **spectator ions** — cancel them:

**Net ionic equation: H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq) → H₂O(l)**

This is the net ionic equation for ANY neutralisation reaction!

---

**Q10.** Write the net ionic equation for the reaction between:

a) Nitric acid (HNO₃) and potassium hydroxide (KOH)

*(Hint: same type of reaction as the example — what will the net equation be?)*

*Answer:*

b) Silver nitrate solution (AgNO₃) and sodium chloride solution (NaCl) — this forms a white precipitate of silver chloride (AgCl)

Full equation: AgNO₃(aq) + NaCl(aq) → AgCl(s) + NaNO₃(aq)

Write the full ionic equation, identify spectator ions, then write the net ionic equation.

*Spectator ions:*

*Net ionic equation:*

## Part 5 — Applied Thinking

**Q11.** Diamond and graphite are both forms of pure carbon, but they have very different properties.

| Property | Diamond | Graphite |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Hardness | Hardest natural substance | Soft and slippery |
| Electrical conductivity | Does not conduct | Conducts electricity |
| Melting point | >3500°C | >3600°C |
| Appearance | Transparent, sparkly | Grey-black, metallic |

Both are giant covalent structures. Research or reason through:

a) Why is diamond so hard?

*Answer:*

b) Why does graphite conduct electricity but diamond does not?

*Answer:*

c) Why are both substances used in such different applications? Give one use for each and explain why.

*Diamond:*

*Graphite:*

## Reflection

**Q12.** Ionic and covalent bonding are both ways atoms achieve stable electron configurations. 

How does the type of element involved (metal vs non-metal, electronegativity) predict which type of bonding will occur? Explain in 3–4 sentences using specific examples.
