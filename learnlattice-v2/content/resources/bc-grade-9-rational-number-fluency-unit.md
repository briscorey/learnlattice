## Overview

Students strengthen fluency with rational numbers by comparing methods and selecting efficient forms for different tasks. The unit centers on structure, estimation, and error analysis.

## BC Curriculum Focus

- BC big idea: Computational fluency and flexibility extend to operations with rational numbers.
- BC content links: operations with integers, fractions, decimals, and percent in multi-step contexts.

## Inquiry Questions

**Factual:** Which number form makes a problem easier to reason about?

**Conceptual:** How do we detect an unreasonable answer before finishing the computation?

**Debatable:** When is method choice part of mathematical expertise rather than preference?

## Learning Flow

- Compare strategies and estimate before solving multi-step problems.
- Analyze common errors in sign, fraction, and percent reasoning.
- Finish with a finance or science context where form choice matters.

## Assessment Alignment

The unit foregrounds **MYP Criterion A** understanding and **Criterion C** explanation of method, notation, and error correction.

> **Teaching Tip:** Keep asking for a reasonableness check. It changes how students approach every computation.
