## Overview

This inquiry sequence helps students explain how cells function as coordinated systems rather than isolated parts. Students begin by observing prepared slides, then compare plant, animal, and specialised cells before modelling how membrane transport supports stable internal conditions.

## Learning Goals

- Identify the functions of the nucleus, membrane, cytoplasm, chloroplasts, and mitochondria
- Compare specialised cells and explain how structure supports function
- Model diffusion and osmosis using evidence from practical tasks
- Connect cell-level processes to the larger idea of homeostasis

## Inquiry Questions

**Factual:** What structures are visible under a microscope? What moves in and out of a cell?

**Conceptual:** How does form support function in living systems? Why is homeostasis a systems idea rather than a single process?

**Debatable:** Are simplified cell models helpful or misleading when students first learn biology?

## Investigation Sequence

### Part A: Looking closely

Students practise microscope setup and observe onion skin, cheek cells, and prepared slides of specialised cells. They annotate observations and compare what can and cannot be seen directly.

### Part B: Cells with jobs

Using case cards, students analyse red blood cells, root hair cells, nerve cells, and palisade cells. They explain how each cell's shape, surface area, and internal structures support a specific role.

### Part C: Transport and balance

Students test osmosis using potato cylinders or gummy-bear models, then use particle diagrams to explain movement across membranes. The final task asks them to connect membrane transport to survival in changing environments.

## Assessment Opportunities

This pack is built around **MYP Criterion B** with extension prompts for **Criterion C**. Students design a fair test for one transport question, collect observations, and communicate conclusions with labelled diagrams and evidence-based explanations.

> **Teaching Tip:** Delay the vocabulary quiz until after students have compared real and modelled cells. The concept load is lower when names are attached to structures students already noticed.
