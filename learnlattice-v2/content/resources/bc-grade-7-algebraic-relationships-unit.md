## Overview

Students generalize numeric and geometric patterns into expressions and early equations. They learn to interpret symbols as relationships among quantities rather than as instructions to calculate immediately.

## BC Curriculum Focus

- BC big idea: Algebraic reasoning allows us to generalize and communicate relationships.
- BC content links: variables, expressions, pattern rules, substitution, and connections between contexts and algebraic forms.

## Inquiry Questions

**Factual:** What does a variable represent in a real situation?

**Conceptual:** Why can two different expressions describe the same pattern?

**Debatable:** How do tables, graphs, and symbols strengthen each other?

## Learning Flow

- Investigate pattern growth and write competing rules.
- Use substitution and tables to test equivalence and meaning.
- Finish with a representation portfolio where students translate one context across multiple forms.

## Assessment Alignment

This unit connects **MYP Criterion B** with structured inquiry and **Criterion C** through precise symbolic and verbal communication.

> **Teaching Tip:** Ask students what each symbol means in context every time they write an expression.
