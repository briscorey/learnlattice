## Overview

Students develop flexible number sense by comparing strategies for large-number computation, estimation, and representation. The unit prioritizes reasoning about quantity and efficiency over one fixed algorithm.

## BC Curriculum Focus

- BC big idea: Computational fluency with numbers extends to larger whole numbers and meaningful estimation.
- BC content links: place value, factors and multiples, operations, and efficient mental or written strategies.

## Inquiry Questions

**Factual:** When is one computation strategy more powerful than another?

**Conceptual:** How does place value shape every operation we do?

**Debatable:** Should efficiency matter more than method consistency in mathematics?

## Learning Flow

- Launch with number talks and estimate-before-calculate routines.
- Compare algorithms, decompositions, and visual models for whole-number operations.
- Finish with a real planning task where students justify strategy choices and estimate reasonableness.

## Assessment Alignment

This unit emphasises **MYP Criterion A** conceptual understanding and **Criterion C** mathematical communication of strategies, notation, and justification.

> **Teaching Tip:** Treat estimation as a first move, not an extension. It makes number structure visible.
