## Overview

Students investigate why some populations persist while others decline when environments change. The unit connects ecosystem interactions, inherited variation, and evidence for natural selection through local fieldwork and species case studies.

## BC Curriculum Focus

- Big idea: Evolution by natural selection provides an explanation for the diversity and survival of living things.
- BC content links: ecosystems, adaptations, biodiversity, and evidence for evolutionary change over time.

## Inquiry Questions

**Factual:** How does environmental change influence which traits persist?

**Conceptual:** What counts as convincing evidence for natural selection?

**Debatable:** Should humans intervene when ecosystem pressures threaten a species?

## Learning Flow

- Map local ecosystem interactions and identify pressures acting on populations.
- Analyze adaptation case studies using fossils, traits, and environmental data.
- Conclude with an evidence-based conservation recommendation grounded in evolutionary reasoning.

## Assessment Alignment

This unit leans on **MYP Criterion B** for question design and evidence collection, then moves into **Criterion D** as students apply evolutionary concepts to an authentic environmental decision.

> **Teaching Tip:** Use contrasting species cases so students see that adaptation is context-specific rather than universally helpful.
