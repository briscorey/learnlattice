## Overview

Students examine how claims are built from data and how chance influences outcomes. They compare samples, critique graphs, and explore the limits of probability predictions.

## BC Curriculum Focus

- BC big idea: Data and probability can be used to make and test claims.
- BC content links: sampling, graph interpretation, theoretical and experimental probability, and bias in data collection.

## Inquiry Questions

**Factual:** How do we know whether a sample is trustworthy?

**Conceptual:** Why can a fair experiment still produce surprising short-term results?

**Debatable:** What responsibilities come with presenting data to persuade others?

## Learning Flow

- Critique media-style graphs and identify misleading choices.
- Run repeated experiments and compare theoretical with experimental results.
- End with a survey or game brief where students defend the validity of their conclusions.

## Assessment Alignment

Assessment integrates **MYP Criterion B** inquiry planning and **Criterion C** communication of data, probability reasoning, and critique.

> **Teaching Tip:** Use conflicting data displays from the same data set to force interpretation discussions.
