## Overview

Students collect, represent, and critique data while comparing expected and experimental outcomes in probability situations. The unit frames data as evidence that must be interpreted carefully.

## BC Curriculum Focus

- BC big idea: Data and chance can be analyzed to make informed decisions.
- BC content links: graphing, central tendency in simple contexts, probability language, and experiments with equally likely outcomes.

## Inquiry Questions

**Factual:** What makes a data display helpful or misleading?

**Conceptual:** How do probability predictions connect to repeated trials?

**Debatable:** When is a sample too weak to support a claim?

## Learning Flow

- Gather class data and compare display choices for clarity and bias.
- Run probability experiments and track how results stabilize over time.
- Finish with an evidence brief where students use data or probability to support a recommendation.

## Assessment Alignment

The unit combines **MYP Criterion B** inquiry with **Criterion C** communication of graphs, calculations, and evidence-based conclusions.

> **Teaching Tip:** Use messy real data early so students feel the difference between computation and interpretation.
