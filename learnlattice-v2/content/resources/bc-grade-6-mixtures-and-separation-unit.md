## Overview

Students treat separation as a design problem rather than a recipe. They compare mixtures, identify useful properties, and justify the best separation strategy for increasingly complex materials.

## BC Curriculum Focus

- Big idea: Everyday materials are often mixtures that can be separated using physical properties.
- BC content links: heterogeneous mixtures, observable properties, and practical separation techniques such as sieving, filtration, evaporation, and magnetism.

## Inquiry Questions

**Factual:** What makes one separation method better than another?

**Conceptual:** How do physical properties help us choose a process?

**Debatable:** Should efficiency matter more than purity in a real separation task?

## Learning Flow

- Sort common classroom mixtures and classify them by observable evidence.
- Test multiple separation methods and track yield, purity, and time.
- Conclude with a challenge in which students design and defend a separation plan for a contaminated sample.

## Assessment Alignment

This unit blends **MYP Criterion B** investigation design with **Criterion C** data recording, evidence processing, and evaluation of method quality.

> **Teaching Tip:** Use imperfect mixtures on purpose so students have to discuss tradeoffs instead of assuming every task has one ideal answer.
