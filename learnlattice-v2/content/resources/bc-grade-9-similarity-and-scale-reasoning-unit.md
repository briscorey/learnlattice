## Overview

Students use similarity to reason about indirect measurement, scale drawings, and geometric comparison. They learn to justify why proportional reasoning applies and what similarity preserves.

## BC Curriculum Focus

- BC big idea: Similar shapes have proportional relationships that can be described, measured, and compared.
- BC content links: scale diagrams, indirect measurement, proportional similarity, and geometric comparison.

## Inquiry Questions

**Factual:** What conditions make two shapes similar rather than just visually alike?

**Conceptual:** How does scale preserve some relationships while changing others?

**Debatable:** When is an indirect measurement more useful than a direct one?

## Learning Flow

- Investigate similarity through image scaling and geometric comparison.
- Use scale drawings and shadow methods for indirect measurement.
- Conclude with a design or mapping task that requires justified proportional reasoning.

## Assessment Alignment

The final task joins **MYP Criterion B** exploration with **Criterion D** by applying similarity to a practical problem with real constraints.

> **Teaching Tip:** Require students to name what is preserved and what changes under scale. That language matters.
