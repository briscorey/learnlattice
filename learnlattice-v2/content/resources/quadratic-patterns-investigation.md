## What is a Quadratic?

A **quadratic function** has the form y = ax² + bx + c, where a ≠ 0.

Its graph is a **parabola** — a symmetrical U-shaped (or ∩-shaped) curve.

Key features:
- **Vertex:** The turning point (minimum or maximum)
- **Axis of symmetry:** Vertical line through the vertex
- **x-intercepts (roots):** Where the parabola crosses the x-axis (y = 0)
- **y-intercept:** Where the parabola crosses the y-axis (x = 0, so y = c)

## Part 1 — Spotting Quadratic Patterns

**Q1.** Look at this pattern of square tiles:

| Pattern number (n) | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|--------------------|----|----|----|----|----|
| Number of tiles | 1 | 4 | 9 | 16 | 25 |

a) What is the rule connecting n and the number of tiles?

*Rule:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

b) How many tiles are in pattern 10? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

c) How many tiles are in pattern n? Write as an expression: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

d) Is this a linear (straight-line) relationship or quadratic? How do you know?

*Answer:*

---

**Q2.** A different tile pattern produces these results:

| n | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tiles | 3 | 8 | 15 | 24 | 35 |

a) Find the **differences between consecutive terms**:

8−3=\_\_, 15−8=\_\_, 24−15=\_\_, 35−24=\_\_

b) Find the **second differences** (differences between your answers in part a):

*Second differences:* \_\_, \_\_, \_\_

c) When second differences are constant, the pattern is quadratic. Is this pattern quadratic? \_\_\_\_\_\_

d) The rule has the form n² + bn + c. Use your table to find b and c.

*(Hint: when n=1, tiles=3 → 1 + b + c = 3. When n=2, tiles=8 → 4 + 2b + c = 8)*

*Working:*

*Rule:* Tiles = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

e) Verify: Check your rule gives the correct answer for n=5.

## Part 2 — Plotting Parabolas

**Q3.** Complete the table of values for y = x²:

| x | −3 | −2 | −1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|----|----|----|----|---|---|---|
| x² | 9 | | | | | | 9 |

a) Plot these points and draw a smooth curve on graph paper.

b) Draw the **axis of symmetry**. What is its equation? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

c) What are the coordinates of the **vertex**? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

d) Where does the parabola cross the x-axis? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

---

**Q4.** Complete the table for y = x² − 4:

| x | −3 | −2 | −1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|----|----|----|----|---|---|---|
| y | | | | −4 | | | |

a) Plot on the same axes as Q3.

b) How does this parabola compare to y = x²? What has changed?

*Answer:*

c) Find the x-intercepts (where y = 0): x² − 4 = 0 → x² = 4 → x = \_\_\_\_

---

**Q5.** Now complete tables for these and describe the effect of each change on y = x²:

**a) y = 2x²**

| x | −2 | −1 | 0 | 1 | 2 |
|---|----|----|---|---|---|
| y | | | 0 | | |

Effect of the coefficient 2: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**b) y = −x²**

| x | −2 | −1 | 0 | 1 | 2 |
|---|----|----|---|---|---|
| y | −4 | | | | −4 |

Effect of the negative sign: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**c) y = (x − 2)²**

| x | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| y | | | 0 | | |

Effect: The vertex has moved to (\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_)

---

## Part 3 — Finding the Equation from a Graph

**Q6.** A parabola passes through these points: (0, 0), (1, −3), (2, −4), (3, −3), (4, 0)

a) Find the axis of symmetry (x-value of vertex).

*Answer:* x = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

b) Find the vertex.

*Answer:* (\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_)

c) The equation has the form y = a(x − h)² + k where (h, k) is the vertex. Substitute the vertex.

*Partial equation:* y = a(x − \_\_\_\_)² + \_\_\_\_

d) Use point (0, 0) to find the value of a.

*Working:*

*a =* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

e) Write the full equation.

*Answer:* y = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

## Part 4 — Solving Quadratic Equations

### Method 1: Factorising

A quadratic can be written in **factored form**: y = (x + p)(x + q)

When y = 0: x = −p or x = −q

**Example:** x² − 5x + 6 = 0

Factorise: (x − 2)(x − 3) = 0

So x = 2 or x = 3

---

**Q7.** Factorise and solve. (Find two numbers that multiply to give c and add to give b in x² + bx + c)

a) x² + 5x + 6 = 0

*(Numbers that multiply to 6 and add to 5: \_\_ and \_\_)*

Factored: (x + \_\_)(x + \_\_) = 0 → x = \_\_ or x = \_\_

---

b) x² − 7x + 10 = 0

Factored: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ → x = \_\_ or x = \_\_

---

c) x² − x − 12 = 0

Factored: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ → x = \_\_ or x = \_\_

---

d) x² + 2x − 15 = 0

Factored: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ → x = \_\_ or x = \_\_

---

### Method 2: The Quadratic Formula

When factorising doesn't work, use:

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

**Q8.** Solve using the quadratic formula. Round to 2 decimal places.

a) x² + 3x − 5 = 0 (a=1, b=3, c=−5)

*Discriminant (b² − 4ac):* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*x =* \_\_\_\_\_\_ or \_\_\_\_\_\_

---

b) 2x² − 5x + 1 = 0

*Working:*

*x =* \_\_\_\_\_\_ or \_\_\_\_\_\_

---

c) x² + x + 3 = 0 (calculate the discriminant first — what do you notice?)

*Discriminant:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*What does a negative discriminant mean about the graph?*

*Answer:*

## Part 5 — Real-World Modelling

**Q9. The Ball**

A ball is thrown upward. Its height h (in metres) after t seconds is:

$$h = −5t^2 + 20t + 2$$

a) What is the height of the ball when it is released (t = 0)?

*Answer:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ m

b) Complete the table:

| t (s) | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 4.1 |
|--------|---|---|---|---|---|-----|
| h (m) | | | | | | |

c) When does the ball reach its maximum height? (Axis of symmetry: t = −b/2a)

*Working:*

*Answer:* at t = \_\_\_\_\_\_ s

d) What is the maximum height?

*Answer:* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ m

e) When does the ball hit the ground? (Solve h = 0 using the quadratic formula)

*Working:*

*Answer:* at t ≈ \_\_\_\_\_\_ s

**Q10. The Farmer's Fence**

A farmer has 40 m of fencing to enclose a rectangular field. One side of the field is against a wall (no fencing needed).

a) Let x = the width of the field. Write an expression for the length.

*(Total fencing = two widths + one length = 40 m, so length = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_)*

b) Write a formula for the area (A) of the field in terms of x.

*A =* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

c) Expand your formula into standard quadratic form.

d) Find the value of x that maximises the area. (Use axis of symmetry)

*x =* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ m

e) Find the maximum area.

*Maximum area =* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ m²

f) What are the dimensions of the field at maximum area?

*Width:* \_\_\_\_ m, *Length:* \_\_\_\_ m

## Reflection

**Q11.** A student says "A quadratic always has two solutions." Is this always true? Explain three possible cases for the number of solutions and link each to the shape of the parabola and the value of the discriminant (b² − 4ac).

**Q12.** Parabolas appear throughout the real world: satellite dish shapes, suspension bridge cables, the path of projectiles, headlight reflectors. Choose one real-world parabola and explain *why* the quadratic shape is useful for that application.
