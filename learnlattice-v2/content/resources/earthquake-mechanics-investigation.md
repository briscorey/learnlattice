## Overview

This guided inquiry worksheet takes students through the mechanics of earthquakes — from the movement of tectonic plates to the propagation of seismic waves. Students analyse real seismograph data and use evidence to explain patterns in earthquake distribution.

## Learning Objectives

- Describe how P-waves and S-waves differ in their movement and speed
- Explain the relationship between plate boundaries and earthquake locations
- Analyse seismograph data to determine earthquake epicentres
- Evaluate the reliability of earthquake prediction methods

## Structure

The worksheet is divided into three sections:

**Section A: What happens during an earthquake?**
Students use diagrams and descriptions to build understanding of fault types and wave propagation.

**Section B: Data analysis**
Students work with real seismograph readings from the USGS database to triangulate an earthquake epicentre.

**Section C: Can we predict earthquakes?**
An evaluation task where students assess different prediction methods and form an evidence-based conclusion.

> **MYP Alignment:** This task targets Criterion B (Inquiring and Designing) with emphasis on formulating testable hypotheses and analysing data.
