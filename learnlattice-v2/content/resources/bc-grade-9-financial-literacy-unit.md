## Overview

Students apply mathematical reasoning to earnings, expenses, savings, and financial choices. The unit treats financial literacy as modelling, communication, and ethical decision-making rather than isolated skill practice.

## BC Curriculum Focus

- BC big idea: The principles of financial literacy can be applied to different contexts.
- BC content links: budgeting, percent increase and decrease, taxes, discounts, simple financial comparisons, and responsible decision-making.

## Inquiry Questions

**Factual:** What makes a financial plan realistic rather than just balanced on paper?

**Conceptual:** How do percentages shape everyday financial decisions?

**Debatable:** Should the mathematically cheapest option always be the best choice?

## Learning Flow

- Analyze real financial scenarios with tradeoffs and constraints.
- Model spending, saving, discount, and fee situations using multiple representations.
- Finish with a personal or community budget proposal supported by mathematics and justification.

## Assessment Alignment

The culminating task centers **MYP Criterion D** application in a real-life context, supported by **Criterion C** through clear communication of assumptions, calculations, and recommendations.

> **Teaching Tip:** Use incomplete or messy financial information so students must ask questions and state assumptions.
