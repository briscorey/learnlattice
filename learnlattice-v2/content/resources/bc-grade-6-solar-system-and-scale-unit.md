## Overview

Students explore how scientists know about objects they cannot directly visit. They compare scale models, observation records, and planetary data to explain position, motion, and relative size in the solar system.

## BC Curriculum Focus

- Big idea: The solar system is part of the Milky Way, which is one of billions of galaxies.
- BC content links: components of the solar system, relative scale, and evidence gathered through models and astronomical observation.

## Inquiry Questions

**Factual:** How do scientists build knowledge about distant objects?

**Conceptual:** Why are scale models powerful and misleading at the same time?

**Debatable:** Does a model count as evidence, or only as a tool for thinking?

## Learning Flow

- Build a scale walk that reveals distance and size distortions.
- Interpret day-length, orbit, and planetary data from multiple representations.
- Finish with a museum-style display in which students defend the usefulness and limits of a chosen model.

## Assessment Alignment

The final task connects strongly to **MYP Criterion B** through model selection and **Criterion D** through application of scale ideas in a new context.

> **Teaching Tip:** Have students critique the model before celebrating it. That shift improves scientific reasoning immediately.
