## Overview

Students investigate how electricity and magnetism interact by building and troubleshooting working devices. The emphasis is on causal reasoning, not just assembling circuits that happen to work.

## BC Curriculum Focus

- Big idea: Electromagnetism can be used to create useful devices.
- BC content links: simple circuits, current flow, magnetic fields, electromagnets, and technological applications of electrical transfer.

## Inquiry Questions

**Factual:** What evidence shows that electricity and magnetism are connected?

**Conceptual:** Why do some circuit designs fail even when all the parts are present?

**Debatable:** How should usefulness, safety, and efficiency shape a device design?

## Learning Flow

- Explore static and current electricity through short puzzling demonstrations.
- Build and revise circuits, motors, or electromagnets while tracking design choices.
- Finish with a prototype task in which students justify how their device meets a chosen need.

## Assessment Alignment

The unit combines **MYP Criterion B** design thinking with **Criterion C** data processing, troubleshooting notes, and evaluation of prototype performance.

> **Teaching Tip:** Require students to explain failed trials in writing. Debugging is where the real conceptual work happens.
