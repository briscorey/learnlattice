## Overview

Students investigate how living things maintain continuity through cell division and reproduction. The unit links microscopic processes to visible growth, inheritance patterns, and ethical questions about reproductive technologies.

## BC Curriculum Focus

- Big idea: Cells are derived from cells.
- BC content links: cell division, sexual and asexual reproduction, DNA as hereditary material, and the role of reproduction in continuity of life.

## Inquiry Questions

**Factual:** Why is cell division essential for both single-celled and multicellular organisms?

**Conceptual:** How are growth, repair, and reproduction related but not identical?

**Debatable:** How should scientific knowledge about reproduction be used in society?

## Learning Flow

- Model the cell cycle and compare sexual with asexual reproduction in case studies.
- Analyze heredity and continuity through diagrams, simulations, and evidence sets.
- Conclude with an explanation task that connects cell processes to a real biological or ethical context.

## Assessment Alignment

This unit combines **MYP Criterion B** investigation thinking with **Criterion C** scientific communication and evaluation of biological evidence.

> **Teaching Tip:** Avoid teaching mitosis as a sequence to memorise first. Start with the problem of continuity and let stages answer that problem.
