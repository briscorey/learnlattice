## Overview

Students investigate how comparison changes when scale, rate, or percent is involved. They solve problems by reasoning multiplicatively and defend why proportional models are or are not appropriate.

## BC Curriculum Focus

- BC big idea: Proportional relationships help us compare quantities and make sense of scale.
- BC content links: ratios, rates, unit rates, percent, and proportional reasoning across measurement and financial contexts.

## Inquiry Questions

**Factual:** What clues tell us a situation is proportional?

**Conceptual:** Why is multiplicative thinking different from additive thinking?

**Debatable:** When does percent clarify a comparison, and when does it hide important detail?

## Learning Flow

- Compare recipes, maps, and pricing scenarios to surface proportional structure.
- Represent relationships with tables, double number lines, and equations.
- Conclude with a consumer or scale-design task where students justify model choice.

## Assessment Alignment

The culminating assessment joins **MYP Criterion B** investigation with **Criterion D** by applying proportional reasoning to unfamiliar real-life decisions.

> **Teaching Tip:** Use non-proportional examples deliberately so students learn to reject the wrong model.
