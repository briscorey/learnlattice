## Overview

This series of three practical lab activities introduces students to the fundamental techniques used to separate mixtures. Each lab builds on the previous one, progressing from simple mechanical separation to more complex chemical methods.

## Lab 1: Filtration & Evaporation

Students separate a sand-salt-water mixture using filtration and evaporation. This lab introduces the concepts of soluble vs insoluble substances and the role of particle size in separation.

**Key question:** How can we use the physical properties of substances to separate them?

## Lab 2: Distillation

Students set up a simple distillation apparatus to separate a salt water solution. They observe the process of evaporation and condensation and collect the distilled water for testing.

**Key question:** What happens to dissolved substances when water changes state?

## Lab 3: Chromatography

Students use paper chromatography to separate the pigments in different coloured inks. They calculate Rf values and use their results to identify unknown ink samples.

**Key question:** How can we separate substances that appear to be the same?

## Assessment Integration

Each lab includes a scaffolded write-up template targeting **MYP Criterion C** (Processing and Evaluating). Students collect data, process it into appropriate formats, and evaluate the reliability of their results.

> **Safety Note:** Lab 2 requires direct supervision when using the Bunsen burner for distillation. Ensure all students have completed a safety briefing before starting.
