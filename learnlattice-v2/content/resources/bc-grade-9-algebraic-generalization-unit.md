## Overview

Students use algebra to generalize patterns and express relationships efficiently. The unit strengthens manipulation only insofar as it clarifies structure and supports explanation.

## BC Curriculum Focus

- BC big idea: Algebra allows us to generalize relationships through patterns.
- BC content links: expressions, equations, variables, linear and non-linear pattern analysis, and symbolic generalization.

## Inquiry Questions

**Factual:** What makes an algebraic rule more powerful than a recursive description?

**Conceptual:** How can two equations look different but express the same relationship?

**Debatable:** Why is generalization central to mathematics rather than an advanced extra?

## Learning Flow

- Analyze visual and numeric patterns and compare recursive versus explicit rules.
- Represent relationships using equations, tables, and graphs.
- Conclude with an algebra exhibition where students defend a generalization in multiple forms.

## Assessment Alignment

This unit supports **MYP Criterion A** conceptual understanding and **Criterion C** communication of symbolic reasoning and equivalence.

> **Teaching Tip:** Keep asking students what the variables stand for. Meaning prevents empty symbol work.
