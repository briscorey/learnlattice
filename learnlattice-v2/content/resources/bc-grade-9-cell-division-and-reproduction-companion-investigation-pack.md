## Overview

This companion investigation pack extends [BC Grade 9 Cell Division and Reproduction Unit](/resources/bc-grade-9-cell-division-and-reproduction-unit/) with a tighter evidence-collection cycle, student recording structures, and follow-up prompts that keep the inquiry focused on explanation rather than procedure.

## What's Included

- A puzzling starter or phenomenon prompt that reconnects students to the central question of the unit.
- Student recording tables or observation frames designed to surface patterns and anomalies.
- Claim-evidence-reasoning prompts that require students to justify conclusions with data or models.
- An extension task that pushes the science into a new context, design challenge, or local issue.

## Inquiry Prompts

**Factual:** What new evidence or pattern becomes visible when students work through this task carefully?

**Conceptual:** How does this companion task deepen the main relationship or system from the unit instead of repeating it?

**Debatable:** What should count as a strong explanation or justified solution in this topic?

## MYP Alignment

This companion resource reinforces **MYP Criterion B** through investigative thinking and planning, with additional support for **Criterion C** or **Criterion D** depending on whether students are processing evidence or applying the science to a new context.

## Suggested Use

Use it mid-unit when students need a tighter practical cycle, or after the main unit as a focused performance task that surfaces misconceptions before summative assessment.

> **Teaching Tip:** Keep the written structure, but trim any repeated instructions once students show they can carry the inquiry routine independently.
