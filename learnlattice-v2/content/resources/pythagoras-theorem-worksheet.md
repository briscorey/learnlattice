## What You Need to Know

In any **right-angled triangle**, the square of the hypotenuse (the longest side, opposite the right angle) equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

Where **c** is always the hypotenuse.

**Two types of problems:**
- **Finding the hypotenuse:** c = √(a² + b²)
- **Finding a shorter side:** a = √(c² − b²)

---

## Worked Example 1 — Finding the Hypotenuse

> A right-angled triangle has legs of 6 cm and 8 cm. Find the hypotenuse.

**Step 1:** Identify a = 6, b = 8, find c.

**Step 2:** c² = 6² + 8² = 36 + 64 = 100

**Step 3:** c = √100 = **10 cm**

---

## Worked Example 2 — Finding a Shorter Side

> A right-angled triangle has a hypotenuse of 13 cm and one leg of 5 cm. Find the missing leg.

**Step 1:** Identify c = 13, b = 5, find a.

**Step 2:** a² = c² − b² = 13² − 5² = 169 − 25 = 144

**Step 3:** a = √144 = **12 cm**

## Section B — Pythagorean Triples

A **Pythagorean triple** is a set of three whole numbers that satisfies a² + b² = c².

**Example:** 3, 4, 5 → 9 + 16 = 25 ✓

**Q6.** Check whether each set of numbers is a Pythagorean triple. Write **Yes** or **No** and show your check.

| a | b | c | a² + b² | c² | Triple? |
|---|---|---|---------|----|---------|
| 6 | 8 | 10 | | | |
| 5 | 11 | 13 | | | |
| 8 | 15 | 17 | | | |
| 9 | 12 | 15 | | | |
| 7 | 24 | 25 | | | |
