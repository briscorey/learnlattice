## Our Approach

LearnLattice is a free resource library for middle school mathematics and science teachers and their students. Every resource on this site is designed with one principle in mind: **understanding comes from connection**.

Just like a lattice structure — where each node gains strength from its connections to others — real learning happens when students can link new concepts to what they already know, see patterns across disciplines, and build understanding through inquiry rather than memorisation.

## Designed with Understanding by Design

All resources follow the Understanding by Design (UbD) framework:

1. **Start with the end in mind** — every resource identifies the key understandings and essential questions first
2. **Think about assessment** — how will students demonstrate their understanding?
3. **Then plan the learning** — design activities that build toward deep understanding

This means you won't find worksheets full of repetitive practice problems here. Instead, you'll find inquiry-driven tasks, real-world contexts, and scaffolded investigations that develop genuine mathematical and scientific thinking.

## MYP Aligned

Resources are tagged with MYP assessment criteria (A through D) so you can easily find materials that target specific skills. Whether you're looking for a Criterion B investigation or a Criterion D real-world application task, the tagging system makes it simple.

<h2 id="for-teachers">For Teachers</h2>

Every resource is free to download, adapt, and use in your classroom. If you'd like to modify something for your context — go for it. That's exactly what these resources are designed for.

If you're transitioning from traditional teaching methods to inquiry-based approaches, start with the unit plans. They provide the full framework including essential questions, key understandings, and lesson sequences you can adapt.

Built with curiosity by a teacher who believes every student can think mathematically and scientifically — they just need the right questions to get started.
